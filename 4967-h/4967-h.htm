<p><span class="smcap">This</span> second edition of <i>Luck</i>,
<i>or Cunning</i>? is a reprint of the first edition, dated 1887,
but actually published in November, 1886.&nbsp; The only
alterations of any consequence are in the Index, which has been
enlarged by the incorporation of several entries made by the
author in a copy of the book which came into my possession on the
death of his literary executor, Mr. R. A. Streatfeild.&nbsp; I
thank Mr. G. W. Webb, of the University Library, Cambridge, for
the care and skill with which he has made the necessary
alterations; it was a troublesome job because owing to the
re-setting, the pagination was no longer the same.</p>
<p><i>Luck</i>, <i>or Cunning</i>? is the fourth of
Butler&rsquo;s evolution books; it was followed in 1890 by three
articles in <i>The Universal Review</i> entitled &ldquo;The
Deadlock in Darwinism&rdquo; (republished in <i>The Humour of
Homer</i>), after which he published no more upon that
subject.</p>
<p>In this book, as he says in his Introduction, he insists upon
two main points: (1) the substantial identity between heredity
and memory, and (2) the reintroduction of design into organic
development; and these two points he treats as though they have
something of that physical life with which they are so closely
associated.&nbsp; He was aware that what he had to say was likely
to prove more interesting to future generations than to his
immediate public, &ldquo;but any book that desires to see out a
literary three-score years and ten must offer something to future
generations as well as to its own.&rdquo;&nbsp; By next year one
half of the three-score years and ten will have passed, and the
new generation by their constant enquiries for the work have
already begun to show their appreciation of Butler&rsquo;s method
of treating the subject, and their readiness to listen to what
was addressed to them as well as to their fathers.</p>

7</span>Author&rsquo;s Preface to First Edition</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book, as I have said in my
concluding chapter, has turned out very different from the one I
had it in my mind to write when I began it.&nbsp; It arose out of
a conversation with the late Mr. Alfred Tylor soon after his
paper on the growth of trees and protoplasmic continuity was read
before the Linnean Society&mdash;that is to say, in December,
1884&mdash;and I proposed to make the theory concerning the
subdivision of organic life into animal and vegetable, which I
have broached in my concluding chapter, the main feature of the
book.&nbsp; One afternoon, on leaving Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s bedside,
much touched at the deep disappointment he evidently felt at
being unable to complete the work he had begun so ably, it
occurred to me that it might be some pleasure to him if I
promised to dedicate my own book to him, and thus, however
unworthy it might be, connect it with his name.&nbsp; It occurred
to me, of course, also that the honour to my own book would be
greater than any it could confer, but the time was not one for
balancing considerations nicely, and when I made my suggestion to
Mr. Tylor on the last occasion that I ever saw him, the manner in
which he received it settled the question.&nbsp; If he had lived
I should no doubt have kept more closely to my plan, and should
probably have been furnished by him with much that would have
enriched the book and made it more worthy of his acceptance; but
this was not to be.</p>
<p>In the course of writing I became more and more convinced that
no progress could be made towards a sounder view of the theory of
descent until people came to understand what the late Mr. Charles
Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection amounted to, and how
it was that it ever came to be propounded.&nbsp; Until the
mindless theory of Charles Darwinian natural selection was
finally discredited, and a mindful theory of evolution was
substituted in its place, neither Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s experiments
nor my own theories could stand much chance of being attended
to.&nbsp; I therefore devoted myself mainly, as I had done in
&ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Unconscious
Memory,&rdquo; to considering whether the view taken by the late
Mr. Darwin, or the one put forward by his three most illustrious
predecessors, should most command our assent.</p>
<p>The deflection from my original purpose was increased by the
appearance, about a year ago, of Mr. Grant Allen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Charles Darwin,&rdquo; which I imagine to have had a very
large circulation.&nbsp; So important, indeed, did I think it not
to leave Mr. Allen&rsquo;s statements unchallenged, that in
November last I recast my book completely, cutting out much that
I had written, and practically starting anew.&nbsp; How far Mr.
Tylor would have liked it, or even sanctioned its being dedicated
to him, if he were now living, I cannot, of course, say.&nbsp; I
never heard him speak of the late Mr. Darwin in any but terms of
warm respect, and am by no means sure that he would have been
well pleased at an attempt to connect him with a book so
polemical as the present.&nbsp; On the other hand, a promise made
and received as mine was, cannot be set aside lightly.&nbsp; The
understanding was that my next book was to be dedicated to Mr.
Tylor; I have written the best I could, and indeed never took so
much pains with any other; to Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s memory,
therefore, I have most respectfully, and regretfully, inscribed
it.</p>
<p>Desiring that the responsibility for what has been done should
rest with me, I have avoided saying anything about the book while
it was in progress to any of Mr Tylor&rsquo;s family or
representatives.&nbsp; They know nothing, therefore, of its
contents, and if they did, would probably feel with myself very
uncertain how far it is right to use Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s name in
connection with it.&nbsp; I can only trust that, on the whole,
they may think I have done most rightly in adhering to the letter
of my promise.</p>

13</span>Chapter I<br />
Introduction</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">shall</span> perhaps best promote the
acceptance of the two main points on which I have been insisting
for some years past, I mean, the substantial identity between
heredity and memory, and the reintroduction of design into
organic development, by treating them as if they had something of
that physical life with which they are so closely
connected.&nbsp; Ideas are like plants and animals in this
respect also, as in so many others, that they are more fully
understood when their relations to other ideas of their time, and
the history of their development are known and borne in
mind.&nbsp; By development I do not merely mean their growth in
the minds of those who first advanced them, but that larger
development which consists in their subsequent good or evil
fortunes&mdash;in their reception, favourable or otherwise, by
those to whom they were presented.&nbsp; This is to an idea what
its surroundings are to an organism, and throws much the same
light upon it that knowledge of the conditions under which an
organism lives throws upon the organism itself.&nbsp; I shall,
therefore, begin this new work with a few remarks about its
predecessors.</p>
<p>I am aware that what I may say on this head is likely to prove
more interesting to future students of the literature of descent
than to my immediate public, but any book that desires to see out
a literary three-score years and ten must offer something to
future generations as well as to its own.&nbsp; It is a condition
of its survival that it shall do this, and herein lies one of the
author&rsquo;s chief difficulties.&nbsp; If books only lived as
long as men and women, we should know better how to grow them; as
matters stand, however, the author lives for one or two
generations, whom he comes in the end to understand fairly well,
while the book, if reasonable pains have been taken with it,
should live more or less usefully for a dozen.&nbsp; About the
greater number of these generations the author is in the dark;
but come what may, some of them are sure to have arrived at
conclusions diametrically opposed to our own upon every subject
connected with art, science, philosophy, and religion; it is
plain, therefore, that if posterity is to be pleased, it can only
be at the cost of repelling some present readers.&nbsp; Unwilling
as I am to do this, I still hold it the lesser of two evils; I
will be as brief, however, as the interests of the opinions I am
supporting will allow.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; I contended that heredity was
a mode of memory.&nbsp; I endeavoured to show that all hereditary
traits, whether of mind or body, are inherited in virtue of, and
as a manifestation of, the same power whereby we are able to
remember intelligently what we did half an hour, yesterday, or a
twelvemonth since, and this in no figurative but in a perfectly
real sense.&nbsp; If life be compared to an equation of a hundred
unknown quantities, I followed Professor Hering of Prague in
reducing it to one of ninety-nine only, by showing two of the
supposed unknown quantities to be so closely allied that they
should count as one.&nbsp; I maintained that instinct was
inherited memory, and this without admitting more exceptions and
qualifying clauses than arise, as it were, by way of harmonics
from every proposition, and must be neglected if thought and
language are to be possible.</p>
<p>I showed that if the view for which I was contending was
taken, many facts which, though familiar, were still without
explanation or connection with our other ideas, would remain no
longer isolated, but be seen at once as joined with the mainland
of our most assured convictions.&nbsp; Among the things thus
brought more comfortably home to us was the principle underlying
longevity.&nbsp; It became apparent why some living beings should
live longer than others, and how any race must be treated whose
longevity it is desired to increase.&nbsp; Hitherto we had known
that an elephant was a long-lived animal and a fly short-lived,
but we could give no reason why the one should live longer than
the other; that is to say, it did not follow in immediate
coherence with, or as intimately associated with, any familiar
principle that an animal which is late in the full development of
its reproductive system will tend to live longer than one which
reproduces early.&nbsp; If the theory of &ldquo;Life and
Habit&rdquo; be admitted, the fact of a slow-growing animal being
in general longer lived than a quick developer is seen to be
connected with, and to follow as a matter of course from, the
fact of our being able to remember anything at all, and all the
well-known traits of memory, as observed where we can best take
note of them, are perceived to be reproduced with singular
fidelity in the development of an animal from its embryonic
stages to maturity.</p>
<p>Take this view, and the very general sterility of hybrids from
being a <i>crux</i> of the theory of descent becomes a stronghold
of defence.&nbsp; It appears as part of the same story as the
benefit derived from judicious, and the mischief from
injudicious, crossing; and this, in its turn, is seen as part of
the same story, as the good we get from change of air and scene
when we are overworked.&nbsp; I will not amplify; but reversion
to long-lost, or feral, characteristics, the phenomena of old
age, the fact of the reproductive system being generally the last
to arrive at maturity&mdash;few further developments occurring in
any organism after this has been attained&mdash;the sterility of
many animals in confinement, the development in both males and
females under certain circumstances of the characteristics of the
opposite sex, the latency of memory, the unconsciousness with
which we grow, and indeed perform all familiar actions, these
points, though hitherto, most of them, so apparently inexplicable
that no one even attempted to explain them, became at once
intelligible, if the contentions of &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo;
were admitted.</p>
<p>Before I had finished writing this book I fell in with
Professor Mivart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genesis of Species,&rdquo; and
for the first time understood the distinction between the
Lamarckian and Charles-Darwinian systems of evolution.&nbsp; This
had not, so far as I then knew, been as yet made clear to us by
any of our more prominent writers upon the subject of descent
with modification; the distinction was unknown to the general
public, and indeed is only now beginning to be widely
understood.&nbsp; While reading Mr. Mivart&rsquo;s book, however,
I became aware that I was being faced by two facts, each
incontrovertible, but each, if its leading exponents were to be
trusted, incompatible with the other.</p>
<p>On the one hand there was descent; we could not read Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s books and doubt that all, both animals and plants,
were descended from a common source.&nbsp; On the other, there
was design; we could not read Paley and refuse to admit that
design, intelligence, adaptation of means to ends, must have had
a large share in the development of the life we saw around us; it
seemed indisputable that the minds and bodies of all living
beings must have come to be what they are through a wise ordering
and administering of their estates.&nbsp; We could not,
therefore, dispense either with descent or with design, and yet
it seemed impossible to keep both, for those who offered us
descent stuck to it that we could have no design, and those,
again, who spoke so wisely and so well about design would not for
a moment hear of descent with modification.</p>
<p>Each, moreover, had a strong case.&nbsp; Who could reflect
upon rudimentary organs, and grant Paley the kind of design that
alone would content him?&nbsp; And yet who could examine the foot
or the eye, and grant Mr. Darwin his denial of forethought and
plan?</p>
<p>For that Mr. Darwin did deny skill and contrivance in
connection with the greatly preponderating part of organic
developments cannot be and is not now disputed.&nbsp; In the
first chapter of &ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; I brought
forward passages to show how completely he and his followers deny
design, but will here quote one of the latest of the many that
have appeared to the same effect since &ldquo;Evolution Old and
New&rdquo; was published; it is by Mr. Romanes, and runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the <i>very essence</i> of the Darwinian
hypothesis that it only seeks to explain the <i>apparently</i>
purposive variations, or variations of an adaptive kind.&rdquo;

class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>The words &ldquo;apparently purposive&rdquo; show that those
organs in animals and plants which at first sight seem to have
been designed with a view to the work they have to do&mdash;that
is to say, with a view to future function&mdash;had not,
according to Mr. Darwin, in reality any connection with, or
inception in, effort; effort involves purpose and design; they
had therefore no inception in design, however much they might
present the appearance of being designed; the appearance was
delusive; Mr. Romanes correctly declares it to be &ldquo;the very
essence&rdquo; of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s system to attempt an
explanation of these seemingly purposive variations which shall
be compatible with their having arisen without being in any way
connected with intelligence or design.</p>
<p>As it is indisputable that Mr. Darwin denied design, so
neither can it be doubted that Paley denied descent with
modification.&nbsp; What, then, were the wrong entries in these
two sets of accounts, on the detection and removal of which they
would be found to balance as they ought?</p>
<p>Paley&rsquo;s weakest place, as already implied, is in the
matter of rudimentary organs; the almost universal presence in
the higher organisms of useless, and sometimes even troublesome,
organs is fatal to the kind of design he is trying to uphold;
granted that there is design, still it cannot be so final and
far-foreseeing as he wishes to make it out.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s weak place, on the other hand, lies, firstly, in
the supposition that because rudimentary organs imply no purpose
now, they could never in time past have done so&mdash;that
because they had clearly not been designed with an eye to all
circumstances and all time, they never, therefore, could have
been designed with an eye to any time or any circumstances; and,
secondly, in maintaining that &ldquo;accidental,&rdquo;
&ldquo;fortuitous,&rdquo; &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; variations
could be accumulated at all except under conditions that have
never been fulfilled yet, and never will be; in other words, his
weak place lay in the contention (for it comes to this) that
there can be sustained accumulation of bodily wealth, more than
of wealth of any other kind, unless sustained experience,
watchfulness, and good sense preside over the accumulation.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; following Mr. Mivart, and, as I
now find, Mr. Herbert Spencer, I showed (pp. 279&ndash;281) how
impossible it was for variations to accumulate unless they were
for the most part underlain by a sustained general principle; but
this subject will be touched upon more fully later on.</p>
<p>The accumulation of accidental variations which owed nothing
to mind either in their inception, or their accumulation, the
pitchforking, in fact, of mind out of the universe, or at any
rate its exclusion from all share worth talking about in the
process of organic development, this was the pill Mr. Darwin had
given us to swallow; but so thickly had he gilded it with descent
with modification, that we did as we were told, swallowed it
without a murmur, were lavish in our expressions of gratitude,
and, for some twenty years or so, through the mouths of our
leading biologists, ordered design peremptorily out of court, if
she so much as dared to show herself.&nbsp; Indeed, we have even
given life pensions to some of the most notable of these
biologists, I suppose in order to reward them for having
hoodwinked us so much to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>Happily the old saying, <i>Naturam expellas furc&acirc;</i>,
<i>tamen usque recurret</i>, still holds true, and the reaction
that has been gaining force for some time will doubtless ere long
brush aside the cobwebs with which those who have a vested
interest in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s reputation as a philosopher still
try to fog our outlook.&nbsp; Professor Mivart was, as I have
said, among the first to awaken us to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s denial
of design, and to the absurdity involved therein.&nbsp; He well
showed how incredible Mr Darwin&rsquo;s system was found to be,
as soon as it was fully realised, but there he rather left
us.&nbsp; He seemed to say that we must have our descent and our
design too, but he did not show how we were to manage this with
rudimentary organs still staring us in the face.&nbsp; His work
rather led up to the clearer statement of the difficulty than
either put it before us in so many words, or tried to remove
it.&nbsp; Nevertheless there can be no doubt that the
&ldquo;Genesis of Species&rdquo; gave Natural Selection what will
prove sooner or later to be its death-blow, in spite of the
persistence with which many still declare that it has received no
hurt, and the sixth edition of the &ldquo;Origin of
Species,&rdquo; published in the following year, bore abundant
traces of the fray.&nbsp; Moreover, though Mr. Mivart gave us no
overt aid, he pointed to the source from which help might come,
by expressly saying that his most important objection to
Neo-Darwinism had no force against Lamarck.</p>
<p>To Lamarck, therefore, I naturally turned, and soon saw that
the theory on which I had been insisting in &ldquo;Life and
Habit&rdquo; was in reality an easy corollary on his system,
though one which he does not appear to have caught sight
of.&nbsp; I saw also that his denial of design was only, so to
speak, skin deep, and that his system was in reality
teleological, inasmuch as, to use Isidore Geoffroy&rsquo;s words,
it makes the organism design itself.&nbsp; In making variations
depend on changed actions, and these, again, on changed views of
life, efforts, and designs, in consequence of changed conditions
of life, he in effect makes effort, intention, will, all of which
involve design (or at any rate which taken together involve it),
underlie progress in organic development.&nbsp; True, he did not
know he was a teleologist, but he was none the less a teleologist
for this.&nbsp; He was an unconscious teleologist, and as such
perhaps more absolutely an upholder of teleology than Paley
himself; but this is neither here nor there; our concern is not
with what people think about themselves, but with what their
reasoning makes it evident that they really hold.</p>
<p>How strange the irony that hides us from ourselves!&nbsp; When
Isidore Geoffroy said that according to Lamarck organisms
designed themselves, <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a> and endorsed this,
as to a great extent he did, he still does not appear to have
seen that either he or Lamarck were in reality reintroducing
design into organism; he does not appear to have seen this more
than Lamarck himself had seen it, but, on the contrary, like
Lamarck, remained under the impression that he was opposing
teleology or purposiveness.</p>
<p>Of course in one sense he did oppose it; so do we all, if the
word design be taken to intend a very far-foreseeing of minute
details, a riding out to meet trouble long before it comes, a
provision on academic principles for contingencies that are
little likely to arise.&nbsp; We can see no evidence of any such
design as this in nature, and much everywhere that makes against
it.&nbsp; There is no such improvidence as over providence, and
whatever theories we may form about the origin and development of
the universe, we may be sure that it is not the work of one who
is unable to understand how anything can possibly go right unless
he sees to it himself.&nbsp; Nature works departmentally and by
way of leaving details to subordinates.&nbsp; But though those
who see nature thus do indeed deny design of the
prescient-from-all-eternity order, they in no way impugn a method
which is far more in accord with all that we commonly think of as
design.&nbsp; A design which is as incredible as that a ewe
should give birth to a lion becomes of a piece with all that we
observe most frequently if it be regarded rather as an
aggregation of many small steps than as a single large one.&nbsp;
This principle is very simple, but it seems rather difficult to
understand.&nbsp; It has taken several generations before people
would admit it as regards organism even after it was pointed out
to them, and those who saw it as regards organism still failed to
understand it as regards design; an inexorable &ldquo;Thus far
shalt thou go and no farther&rdquo; barred them from fruition of
the harvest they should have been the first to reap.&nbsp; The
very men who most insisted that specific difference was the
accumulation of differences so minute as to be often hardly, if
at all, perceptible, could not see that the striking and baffling
phenomena of design in connection with organism admitted of
exactly the same solution as the riddle of organic development,
and should be seen not as a result reached <i>per saltum</i>, but
as an accumulation of small steps or leaps in a given
direction.&nbsp; It was as though those who had insisted on the
derivation of all forms of the steam-engine from the common
kettle, and who saw that this stands in much the same relations
to the engines, we will say, of the Great Eastern steamship as
the am&oelig;ba to man, were to declare that the Great Eastern
engines were not designed at all, on the ground that no one in
the early kettle days had foreseen so great a future development,
and were unable to understand that a piecemeal <i>solvitur
ambulando</i> design is more omnipresent, all-seeing, and
all-searching, and hence more truly in the strictest sense
design, than any speculative leap of fancy, however bold and even
at times successful.</p>
<p>From Lamarck I went on to Buffon and Erasmus
Darwin&mdash;better men both of them than Lamarck, and treated by
him much as he has himself been treated by those who have come
after him&mdash;and found that the system of these three writers,
if considered rightly, and if the corollary that heredity is only
a mode of memory were added, would get us out of our dilemma as
regards descent and design, and enable us to keep both.&nbsp; We
could do this by making the design manifested in organism more
like the only design of which we know anything, and therefore the
only design of which we ought to speak&mdash;I mean our own.</p>
<p>Our own design is tentative, and neither very far-foreseeing
nor very retrospective; it is a little of both, but much of
neither; it is like a comet with a little light in front of the
nucleus and a good deal more behind it, which ere long, however,
fades away into the darkness; it is of a kind that, though a
little wise before the event, is apt to be much wiser after it,
and to profit even by mischance so long as the disaster is not an
overwhelming one; nevertheless, though it is so interwoven with
luck, there is no doubt about its being design; why, then, should
the design which must have attended organic development be other
than this?&nbsp; If the thing that has been is the thing that
also shall be, must not the thing which is be that which also has
been?&nbsp; Was there anything in the phenomena of organic life
to militate against such a view of design as this?&nbsp; Not only
was there nothing, but this view made things plain, as the
connecting of heredity and memory had already done, which till
now had been without explanation.&nbsp; Rudimentary organs were
no longer a hindrance to our acceptance of design, they became
weighty arguments in its favour.</p>
<p>I therefore wrote &ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo; with
the object partly of backing up &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; and
showing the easy rider it admitted, partly to show how superior
the old view of descent had been to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s, and
partly to reintroduce design into organism.&nbsp; I wrote
&ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; to show that our mental and bodily
acquisitions were mainly stores of memory: I wrote
&ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; to add that the memory must
be a mindful and designing memory.</p>
<p>I followed up these two books with &ldquo;Unconscious
Memory,&rdquo; the main object of which was to show how Professor
Hering of Prague had treated the connection between memory and
heredity; to show, again, how substantial was the difference
between Von Hartmann and myself in spite of some little
superficial resemblance; to put forward a suggestion as regards
the physics of memory, and to meet the most plausible objection
which I have yet seen brought against &ldquo;Life and
Habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since writing these three books I have published nothing on
the connection between heredity and memory, except a few pages of
remarks on Mr. Romanes&rsquo; &ldquo;Mental Evolution in
Animals&rdquo; in my book, <a name="citation23a"></a><a
href="#footnote23a" class="citation">[23a]</a> from which I will
draw whatever seems to be more properly placed here.&nbsp; I have
collected many facts that make my case stronger, but am precluded
from publishing them by the reflection that it is strong enough
already.&nbsp; I have said enough in &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo;
to satisfy any who wish to be satisfied, and those who wish to be
dissatisfied would probably fail to see the force of what I said,
no matter how long and seriously I held forth to them; I believe,
therefore, that I shall do well to keep my facts for my own
private reading and for that of my executors.</p>
<p>I once saw a copy of &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; on Mr.
Bogue&rsquo;s counter, and was told by the very obliging shopman
that a customer had just written something in it which I might
like to see.&nbsp; I said of course I should like to see, and
immediately taking the book read the following&mdash;which it
occurs to me that I am not justified in publishing.&nbsp; What
was written ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a reminder of our pleasant hours on the broad
Atlantic, will Mr. &mdash; please accept this book (which I think
contains more truth, and less evidence of it, than any other I
have met with) from his friend &mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I presume the gentleman had met with the Bible&mdash;a work
which lays itself open to a somewhat similar comment.&nbsp; I was
gratified, however, at what I had read, and take this opportunity
of thanking the writer, an American, for having liked my
book.&nbsp; It was so plain he had been relieved at not finding
the case smothered to death in the weight of its own evidences,
that I resolved not to forget the lesson his words had taught
me.</p>
<p>The only writer in connection with &ldquo;Life and
Habit&rdquo; to whom I am anxious to reply is Mr. Herbert
Spencer, but before doing this I will conclude the present
chapter with a consideration of some general complaints that have
been so often brought against me that it may be worth while to
notice them.</p>
<p>These general criticisms have resolved themselves mainly into
two.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is said that I ought not to write about biology on
the ground of my past career, which my critics declare to have
been purely literary.&nbsp; I wish I might indulge a reasonable
hope of one day becoming a literary man; the expression is not a
good one, but there is no other in such common use, and this must
excuse it; if a man can be properly called literary, he must have
acquired the habit of reading accurately, thinking attentively,
and expressing himself clearly.&nbsp; He must have endeavoured in
all sorts of ways to enlarge the range of his sympathies so as to
be able to put himself easily <i>en rapport</i> with those whom
he is studying, and those whom he is addressing.&nbsp; If he
cannot speak with tongues himself, he is the interpreter of those
who can&mdash;without whom they might as well be silent.&nbsp; I
wish I could see more signs of literary culture among my
scientific opponents; I should find their books much more easy
and agreeable reading if I could; and then they tell me to
satirise the follies and abuses of the age, just as if it was not
this that I was doing in writing about themselves.</p>
<p>What, I wonder, would they say if I were to declare that they
ought not to write books at all, on the ground that their past
career has been too purely scientific to entitle them to a
hearing?&nbsp; They would reply with justice that I should not
bring vague general condemnations, but should quote examples of
their bad writing.&nbsp; I imagine that I have done this more
than once as regards a good many of them, and I dare say I may do
it again in the course of this book; but though I must own to
thinking that the greater number of our scientific men write
abominably, I should not bring this against them if I believed
them to be doing their best to help us; many such men we happily
have, and doubtless always shall have, but they are not those who
push to the fore, and it is these last who are most angry with me
for writing on the subjects I have chosen.&nbsp; They constantly
tell me that I am not a man of science; no one knows this better
than I do, and I am quite used to being told it, but I am not
used to being confronted with the mistakes that I have made in
matters of fact, and trust that this experience is one which I
may continue to spare no pains in trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I again freely grant that I am not a man of
science.&nbsp; I have never said I was.&nbsp; I was educated for
the Church.&nbsp; I was once inside the Linnean Society&rsquo;s
rooms, but have no present wish to go there again; though not a
man of science, however, I have never affected indifference to
the facts and arguments which men of science have made it their
business to lay before us; on the contrary, I have given the
greater part of my time to their consideration for several years
past.&nbsp; I should not, however, say this unless led to do so
by regard to the interests of theories which I believe to be as
nearly important as any theories can be which do not directly
involve money or bodily convenience.</p>
<p>The second complaint against me is to the effect that I have
made no original experiments, but have taken all my facts at
second hand.&nbsp; This is true, but I do not see what it has to
do with the question.&nbsp; If the facts are sound, how can it
matter whether A or B collected them?&nbsp; If Professor Huxley,
for example, has made a series of valuable original observations
(not that I know of his having done so), why am I to make them
over again?&nbsp; What are fact-collectors worth if the fact
co-ordinators may not rely upon them?&nbsp; It seems to me that
no one need do more than go to the best sources for his facts,
and tell his readers where he got them.&nbsp; If I had had
occasion for more facts I daresay I should have taken the
necessary steps to get hold of them, but there was no difficulty
on this score; every text-book supplied me with all, and more
than all, I wanted; my complaint was that the facts which Mr.
Darwin supplied would not bear the construction he tried to put
upon them; I tried, therefore, to make them bear another which
seemed at once more sound and more commodious; rightly or wrongly
I set up as a builder, not as a burner of bricks, and the
complaint so often brought against me of not having made
experiments is about as reasonable as complaint against an
architect on the score of his not having quarried with his own
hands a single one of the stones which he has used in
building.&nbsp; Let my opponents show that the facts which they
and I use in common are unsound, or that I have misapplied them,
and I will gladly learn my mistake, but this has hardly, to my
knowledge, been attempted.&nbsp; To me it seems that the chief
difference between myself and some of my opponents lies in this,
that I take my facts from them with acknowledgment, and they take
their theories from me&mdash;without.</p>
<p>One word more and I have done.&nbsp; I should like to say that
I do not return to the connection between memory and heredity
under the impression that I shall do myself much good by doing
so.&nbsp; My own share in the matter was very small.&nbsp; The
theory that heredity is only a mode of memory is not mine, but
Professor Hering&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He wrote in 1870, and I not till
1877.&nbsp; I should be only too glad if he would take his theory
and follow it up himself; assuredly he could do so much better
than I can; but with the exception of his one not lengthy address
published some fifteen or sixteen years ago he has said nothing
upon the subject, so far at least as I have been able to
ascertain; I tried hard to draw him in 1880, but could get
nothing out of him.&nbsp; If, again, any of our more influential
writers, not a few of whom evidently think on this matter much as
I do, would eschew ambiguities and tell us what they mean in
plain language, I would let the matter rest in their abler hands,
but of this there does not seem much chance at present.</p>
<p>I wish there was, for in spite of the interest I have felt in
working the theory out and the information I have been able to
collect while doing so, I must confess that I have found it
somewhat of a white elephant.&nbsp; It has got me into the
hottest of hot water, made a literary Ishmael of me, lost me
friends whom I have been sorry to lose, cost me a good deal of
money, done everything to me, in fact, which a good theory ought
not to do.&nbsp; Still, as it seems to have taken up with me, and
no one else is inclined to treat it fairly, I shall continue to
report its developments from time to time as long as life and
health are spared me.&nbsp; Moreover, Ishmaels are not without
their uses, and they are not a drug in the market just now.</p>
<p>I may now go on to Mr. Spencer.</p>
<h2><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Chapter II<br />
Mr. Herbert Spencer</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Herbert Spencer</span> wrote to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (April 5, 1884), and quoted certain
passages from the 1855 edition of his &ldquo;Principles of
Psychology,&rdquo; &ldquo;the meanings and implications&rdquo;
from which he contended were sufficiently clear.&nbsp; The
passages he quoted were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Though it is manifest that reflex and instinctive
sequences are not determined by the experiences of the
<i>individual</i> organism manifesting them, yet there still
remains the hypothesis that they are determined by the
experiences of the <i>race</i> of organisms forming its ancestry,
which by infinite repetition in countless successive generations
have established these sequences as organic relations (p.
526).</p>
<p>The modified nervous tendencies produced by such new habits of
life are also bequeathed (p. 526).</p>
<p>That is to say, the tendencies to certain combinations of
psychical changes have become organic (p. 527).</p>
<p>The doctrine that the connections among our ideas are
determined by experience must, in consistency, be extended not
only to all the connections established by the accumulated
experiences of every individual, but to all those established by
the accumulated experiences of every race (p. 529).</p>
<p>Here, then, we have one of the simpler forms of instinct
which, under the requisite conditions, must necessarily be
established by accumulated experiences (p. 547).</p>
<p>And manifestly, if the organisation of inner relations, in
correspondence with outer relations, results from a continual
registration of experiences, &amp;c. (p. 551).</p>
<p>On the one hand, Instinct may be regarded as a kind of
organised memory; on the other hand, Memory may be regarded as a
kind of incipient instinct (pp. 555&ndash;6).</p>
<p>Memory, then, pertains to all that class of psychical states
which are in process of being organised.&nbsp; It continues so
long as the organising of them continues; and disappears when the
organisation of them is complete.&nbsp; In the advance of the
correspondence, each more complex class of phenomena which the
organism acquires the power of recognising is responded to at
first irregularly and uncertainly; and there is then a weak
remembrance of the relations.&nbsp; By multiplication of
experiences this remembrance becomes stronger, and the response
more certain.&nbsp; By further multiplication of experiences the
internal relations are at last automatically organised in
correspondence with the external ones; and so conscious memory
passes into unconscious or organic memory.&nbsp; At the same
time, a new and still more complex order of experiences is thus
rendered appreciable; the relations they present occupy the
memory in place of the simpler one; they become gradually
organised; and, like the previous ones, are succeeded by others
more complex still (p. 563).</p>
<p>Just as we saw that the establishment of those compound reflex
actions which we call instincts is comprehensible on the
principle that inner relations are, by perpetual repetition,
organised into correspondence with outer relations; so the
establishment of those consolidated, those indissoluble, those
instinctive mental relations constituting our ideas of Space and
Time, is comprehensible on the same principle (p. 579).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a book published a few weeks before Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
letter appeared <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> I had said that though Mr. Spencer at
times closely approached Professor Hering and &ldquo;Life and
Habit,&rdquo; he had nevertheless nowhere shown that he
considered memory and heredity to be parts of the same story and
parcel of one another.&nbsp; In his letter to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, indeed, he does not profess to have upheld
this view, except &ldquo;by implications;&rdquo; nor yet, though
in the course of the six or seven years that had elapsed since
&ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; was published I had brought out more
than one book to support my earlier one, had he said anything
during those years to lead me to suppose that I was trespassing
upon ground already taken by himself.&nbsp; Nor, again, had he
said anything which enabled me to appeal to his
authority&mdash;which I should have been only too glad to do; at
last, however, he wrote, as I have said, to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> a letter which, indeed, made no express
claim, and nowhere mentioned myself, but &ldquo;the meanings and
implications&rdquo; from which were this time as clear as could
be desired, and amount to an order to Professor Hering and myself
to stand aside.</p>
<p>The question is, whether the passages quoted by Mr. Spencer,
or any others that can be found in his works, show that he
regarded heredity in all its manifestations as a mode of
memory.&nbsp; I submit that this conception is not derivable from
Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s writings, and that even the passages in which
he approaches it most closely are unintelligible till read by the
light of Professor Hering&rsquo;s address and of &ldquo;Life and
Habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, Mr. Spencer made abundant use of such expressions as
&ldquo;the experience of the race,&rdquo; &ldquo;accumulated
experiences,&rdquo; and others like them, but he did not
explain&mdash;and it was here the difficulty lay&mdash;how a race
could have any experience at all.&nbsp; We know what we mean when
we say that an individual has had experience; we mean that he is
the same person now (in the common use of the words), on the
occasion of some present action, as the one who performed a like
action at some past time or times, and that he remembers how he
acted before, so as to be able to turn his past action to
account, gaining in proficiency through practice.&nbsp; Continued
personality and memory are the elements that constitute
experience; where these are present there may, and commonly will,
be experience; where they are absent the word
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; cannot properly be used.</p>
<p>Formerly we used to see an individual as one, and a race as
many.&nbsp; We now see that though this is true as far as it
goes, it is by no means the whole truth, and that in certain
important respects it is the race that is one, and the individual
many.&nbsp; We all admit and understand this readily enough now,
but it was not understood when Mr. Spencer wrote the passages he
adduced in the letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> above referred
to.&nbsp; In the then state of our ideas a race was only a
succession of individuals, each one of them new persons, and as
such incapable of profiting by the experience of its predecessors
except in the very limited number of cases where oral teaching,
or, as in recent times, writing, was possible.&nbsp; The thread
of life was, as I have elsewhere said, remorselessly shorn
between each successive generation, and the importance of the
physical and psychical connection between parents and offspring
had been quite, or nearly quite, lost sight of.&nbsp; It seems
strange how this could ever have been allowed to come about, but
it should be remembered that the Church in the Middle Ages would
strongly discourage attempts to emphasize a connection that would
raise troublesome questions as to who in a future state was to be
responsible for what; and, after all, for nine purposes of life
out of ten the generally received opinion that each person is
himself and nobody else is on many grounds the most
convenient.&nbsp; Every now and then, however, there comes a
tenth purpose, for which the continued personality side of the
connection between successive generations is as convenient as the
new personality side is for the remaining nine, and these tenth
purposes&mdash;some of which are not unimportant&mdash;are
obscured and fulfilled amiss owing to the completeness with which
the more commonly needed conception has overgrown the other.</p>
<p>Neither view is more true than the other, but the one was
wanted every hour and minute of the day, and was therefore kept,
so to speak, in stock, and in one of the most accessible places
of our mental storehouse, while the other was so seldom asked for
that it became not worth while to keep it.&nbsp; By-and-by it was
found so troublesome to send out for it, and so hard to come by
even then, that people left off selling it at all, and if any one
wanted it he must think it out at home as best he could; this was
troublesome, so by common consent the world decided no longer to
busy itself with the continued personality of successive
generations&mdash;which was all very well until it also decided
to busy itself with the theory of descent with
modification.&nbsp; On the introduction of a foe so inimical to
many of our pre-existing ideas the balance of power among them
was upset, and a readjustment became necessary, which is still
far from having attained the next settlement that seems likely to
be reasonably permanent.</p>
<p>To change the illustration, the ordinary view is true for
seven places of decimals, and this commonly is enough; occasions,
however, have now arisen when the error caused by neglect of the
omitted places is appreciably disturbing, and we must have three
or four more.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer showed no more signs of seeing
that he must supply these, and make personal identity continue
between successive generations before talking about inherited (as
opposed to post-natal and educational) experience, than others
had done before him; the race with him, as with every one else
till recently, was not one long individual living indeed in
pulsations, so to speak, but no more losing continued personality
by living in successive generations, than an individual loses it
by living in consecutive days; a race was simply a succession of
individuals, each one of which was held to be an entirely new
person, and was regarded exclusively, or very nearly so, from
this point of view.</p>
<p>When I wrote &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; I knew that the
words &ldquo;experience of the race&rdquo; sounded familiar, and
were going about in magazines and newspapers, but I did not know
where they came from; if I had, I should have given their
source.&nbsp; To me they conveyed no meaning, and vexed me as an
attempt to make me take stones instead of bread, and to palm off
an illustration upon me as though it were an explanation.&nbsp;
When I had worked the matter out in my own way, I saw that the
illustration, with certain additions, would become an
explanation, but I saw also that neither he who had adduced it
nor any one else could have seen how right he was, till much had
been said which had not, so far as I knew, been said yet, and
which undoubtedly would have been said if people had seen their
way to saying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this talk,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;which is made
about the experience of the race, as though the experience of one
man could profit another who knows nothing about him?&nbsp; If a
man eats his dinner it nourishes him and not his neighbour; if he
learns a difficult art it is he that can do it and not his
neighbour&rdquo; (&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; p. 49).</p>
<p>When I wrote thus in 1877, it was not generally seen that
though the father is not nourished by the dinners that the son
eats, yet the son was fed when the father ate before he begot
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any way,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;of showing
that this experience of the race about which so much is said
without the least attempt to show in what way it may, or does,
become the experience of the individual, is in sober seriousness
the experience of one single being only, who repeats on a great
many different occasions, and in slightly different ways, certain
performances with which he has already become exceedingly
familiar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt, as every one else must have felt who reflected upon
the expression in question, that it was fallacious till this was
done.&nbsp; When I first began to write &ldquo;Life and
Habit&rdquo; I did not believe it could be done, but when I had
gone right up to the end, as it were, of my <i>cu de sac</i>, I
saw the path which led straight to the point I had despaired of
reaching&mdash;I mean I saw that personality could not be broken
as between generations, without also breaking it between the
years, days, and moments of a man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; What
differentiates &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; from the
&ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; is the prominence given to
continued personal identity, and hence to <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
memory, as between successive generations; but surely this makes
the two books differ widely.</p>
<p>Ideas can be changed to almost any extent in almost any
direction, if the change is brought about gradually and in
accordance with the rules of all development.&nbsp; As in music
we may take almost any possible discord with pleasing effect if
we have prepared and resolved it rightly, so our ideas will
outlive and outgrow almost any modification which is approached
and quitted in such a way as to fuse the old and new
harmoniously.&nbsp; Words are to ideas what the fairy invisible
cloak was to the prince who wore it&mdash;only that the prince
was seen till he put on the cloak, whereas ideas are unseen until
they don the robe of words which reveals them to us; the words,
however, and the ideas, should be such as fit each other and
stick to one another in our minds as soon as they are brought
together, or the ideas will fly off, and leave the words void of
that spirit by the aid of which alone they can become transmuted
into physical action and shape material things with their own
impress.&nbsp; Whether a discord is too violent or no, depends on
what we have been accustomed to, and on how widely the new
differs from the old, but in no case can we fuse and assimilate
more than a very little new at a time without exhausting our
tempering power&mdash;and hence presently our temper.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer appears to have forgotten that though <i>de
minimis non curat lex</i>,&mdash;though all the laws fail when
applied to trifles,&mdash;yet too sudden a change in the manner
in which our ideas are associated is as cataclysmic and
subversive of healthy evolution as are material convulsions, or
too violent revolutions in politics.&nbsp; This must always be
the case, for change is essentially miraculous, and the only
lawful home of the miracle is in the microscopically small.&nbsp;
Here, indeed, miracles were in the beginning, are now, and ever
shall be, but we are deadened if they are required of us on a
scale which is visible to the naked eye.&nbsp; If we are told to
work them our hands fall nerveless down; if, come what may, we
must do or die, we are more likely to die than to succeed in
doing.&nbsp; If we are required to believe them&mdash;which only
means to fuse them with our other ideas&mdash;we either take the
law into our own hands, and our minds being in the dark fuse
something easier of assimilation, and say we have fused the
miracle; or if we play more fairly and insist on our minds
swallowing and assimilating it, we weaken our judgments, and
<i>pro tanto</i> kill our souls.&nbsp; If we stick out beyond a
certain point we go mad, as fanatics, or at the best make
Coleridges of ourselves; and yet upon a small scale these same
miracles are the breath and essence of life; to cease to work
them is to die.&nbsp; And by miracle I do not merely mean
something new, strange, and not very easy of
comprehension&mdash;I mean something which violates every canon
of thought which in the palpable world we are accustomed to
respect; something as alien to, and inconceivable by, us as
contradiction in terms, the destructibility of force or matter,
or the creation of something out of nothing.&nbsp; This, which
when writ large maddens and kills, writ small is our meat and
drink; it attends each minutest and most impalpable detail of the
ceaseless fusion and diffusion in which change appears to us as
consisting, and which we recognise as growth and decay, or as
life and death.</p>
<p>Claude Bernard says, <i>Rien ne nait</i>, <i>rien ne se
cr&eacute;e</i>, <i>tout se continue</i>.&nbsp; <i>La nature ne
nous offre le spectacle d&rsquo;aucune cr&eacute;ation</i>,
<i>elle est d&rsquo;une &eacute;ternelle continuation</i>; <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> but surely he is insisting upon one
side of the truth only, to the neglect of another which is just
as real, and just as important; he might have said, <i>Rien ne se
continue</i>, <i>tout nait</i>, <i>tout se cr&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp;
<i>La nature ne nous offre le spectacle d&rsquo;aucune
continuation</i>.&nbsp; <i>Elle est d&rsquo;une &eacute;ternelle
cr&eacute;ation</i>; for change is no less patent a fact than
continuity, and, indeed, the two stand or fall together.&nbsp;
True, discontinuity, where development is normal, is on a very
small scale, but this is only the difference between looking at
distances on a small instead of a large map; we cannot have even
the smallest change without a small partial corresponding
discontinuity; on a small scale&mdash;too small, indeed, for us
to cognise&mdash;these breaks in continuity, each one of which
must, so far as our understanding goes, rank as a creation, are
as essential a factor of the phenomena we see around us, as is
the other factor that they shall normally be on too small a scale
for us to find it out.&nbsp; Creations, then, there must be, but
they must be so small that practically they are no
creations.&nbsp; We must have a continuity in discontinuity, and
a discontinuity in continuity; that is to say, we can only
conceive the help of change at all by the help of flat
contradiction in terms.&nbsp; It comes, therefore, to this, that
if we are to think fluently and harmoniously upon any subject
into which change enters (and there is no conceivable subject
into which it does not), we must begin by flying in the face of
every rule that professors of the art of thinking have drawn up
for our instruction.&nbsp; These rules may be good enough as
servants, but we have let them become the worst of masters,
forgetting that philosophy is made for man, not man for
philosophy.&nbsp; Logic has been the true Tower of Babel, which
we have thought to build so that we might climb up into the
heavens, and have no more miracle, but see God and live&mdash;nor
has confusion of tongues failed to follow on our
presumption.&nbsp; Truly St. Paul said well that the just shall
live by faith; and the question &ldquo;By what faith?&rdquo; is a
detail of minor moment, for there are as many faiths as species,
whether of plants or animals, and each of them is in its own way
both living and saving.</p>
<p>All, then, whether fusion or diffusion, whether of ideas or
things, is miraculous.&nbsp; It is the two in one, and at the
same time one in two, which is only two and two making five put
before us in another shape; yet this fusion&mdash;so easy to
think so long as it is not thought about, and so unthinkable if
we try to think it&mdash;is, as it were, the matrix from which
our more thinkable thought is taken; it is the cloud gathering in
the unseen world from which the waters of life descend in an
impalpable dew.&nbsp; Granted that all, whether fusion or
diffusion, whether of ideas or things, is, if we dwell upon it
and take it seriously, an outrage upon our understandings which
common sense alone enables us to brook; granted that it carries
with it a distinctly miraculous element which should vitiate the
whole process <i>ab initio</i>, still, if we have faith we can so
work these miracles as Orpheus-like to charm denizens of the
unseen world into the seen again&mdash;provided we do not look
back, and provided also we do not try to charm half a dozen
Eurydices at a time.&nbsp; To think is to fuse and diffuse ideas,
and to fuse and diffuse ideas is to feed.&nbsp; We can all feed,
and by consequence within reasonable limits we can fuse ideas; or
we can fuse ideas, and by consequence within reasonable limits we
can feed; we know not which comes first, the food or the ideas,
but we must not overtax our strength; the moment we do this we
taste of death.</p>
<p>It is in the closest connection with this that we must chew
our food fine before we can digest it, and that the same food
given in large lumps will choke and kill which in small pieces
feeds us; or, again, that that which is impotent as a pellet may
be potent as a gas.&nbsp; Food is very thoughtful: through
thought it comes, and back through thought it shall return; the
process of its conversion and comprehension within our own system
is mental as well as physical, and here, as everywhere else with
mind and evolution, there must be a cross, but not too wide a
cross&mdash;that is to say, there must be a miracle, but not upon
a large scale.&nbsp; Granted that no one can draw a clear line
and define the limits within which a miracle is healthy working
and beyond which it is unwholesome, any more than he can
prescribe the exact degree of fineness to which we must comminute
our food; granted, again, that some can do more than others, and
that at all times all men sport, so to speak, and surpass
themselves, still we know as a general rule near enough, and find
that the strongest can do but very little at a time, and, to
return to Mr. Spencer, the fusion of two such hitherto
unassociated ideas as race and experience was a miracle beyond
our strength.</p>
<p>Assuredly when Mr. Spencer wrote the passages he quoted in the
letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> above referred to, we were
not in the habit of thinking of any one as able to remember
things that had happened before he had been born or thought
of.&nbsp; This notion will still strike many of my non-readers as
harsh and strained; no such discord, therefore, should have been
taken unprepared, and when taken it should have been resolved
with pomp and circumstance.&nbsp; Mr Spencer, however, though he
took it continually, never either prepared it or resolved it at
all, but by using the words &ldquo;experience of the race&rdquo;
sprang this seeming paradox upon us, with the result that his
words were barren.&nbsp; They were barren because they were
incoherent; they were incoherent because they were approached and
quitted too suddenly.&nbsp; While we were realising
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; our minds excluded &ldquo;race,&rdquo;
inasmuch as experience was an idea we had been accustomed
hitherto to connect only with the individual; while realising the
idea &ldquo;race,&rdquo; for the same reason, we as a matter of
course excluded experience.&nbsp; We were required to fuse two
ideas that were alien to one another, without having had those
other ideas presented to us which would alone flux them.&nbsp;
The absence of these&mdash;which indeed were not immediately
ready to hand, or Mr. Spencer would have doubtless grasped
them&mdash;made nonsense of the whole thing; we saw the ideas
propped up as two cards one against the other, on one of Mr.
Spencer&rsquo;s pages, only to find that they had fallen asunder
before we had turned over to the next, so we put down his book
resentfully, as written by one who did not know what to do with
his meaning even if he had one, or bore it meekly while he
chastised us with scorpions, as Mr. Darwin had done with whips,
according to our temperaments.</p>
<p>I may say, in passing, that the barrenness of incoherent
ideas, and the sterility of widely distant species and genera of
animals and plants, are one in principle&mdash;the sterility of
hybrids being just as much due to inability to fuse widely unlike
and unfamiliar ideas into a coherent whole, as barrenness of
ideas is, and, indeed, resolving itself ultimately into neither
more nor less than barrenness of ideas&mdash;that is to say, into
inability to think at all, or at any rate to think as their
neighbours do.</p>
<p>If Mr. Spencer had made it clear that the generations of any
race are <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> united by a common personality,
and that in virtue of being so united each generation remembers
(within, of course, the limits to which all memory is subject)
what happened to it while still in the persons of its
progenitors&mdash;then his order to Professor Hering and myself
should be immediately obeyed; but this was just what was at once
most wanted, and least done by Mr. Spencer.&nbsp; Even in the
passages given above&mdash;passages collected by Mr. Spencer
himself&mdash;this point is altogether ignored; make it clear as
Professor Hering made it&mdash;put continued personality and
memory in the foreground as Professor Hering did, instead of
leaving them to be discovered &ldquo;by implications,&rdquo; and
then such expressions as &ldquo;accumulated experiences&rdquo;
and &ldquo;experience of the race&rdquo; become luminous; till
this had been done they were <i>Vox et pr&aelig;terea
nihil</i>.</p>
<p>To sum up briefly.&nbsp; The passages quoted by Mr. Spencer
from his &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; can hardly be
called clear, even now that Professor Hering and others have
thrown light upon them.&nbsp; If, indeed, they had been clear Mr.
Spencer would probably have seen what they necesitated, and found
the way of meeting the difficulties of the case which occurred to
Professor Hering and myself.&nbsp; Till we wrote, very few
writers had even suggested this.&nbsp; The idea that offspring
was only &ldquo;an elongation or branch proceeding from its
parents&rdquo; had scintillated in the ingenious brain of Dr.
Erasmus Darwin, and in that of the designer of Jesse tree
windows, but it had kindled no fire; it now turns out that Canon
Kingsley had once called instinct inherited memory, <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a> but the idea, if born alive at all,
died on the page on which it saw light: Professor Ray Lankester,
again called attention to Professor Hering&rsquo;s address
(<i>Nature</i>, July 13, 1876), but no discussion followed, and
the matter dropped without having produced visible effect.&nbsp;
As for offspring remembering in any legitimate sense of the words
what it had done, and what had happened to it, before it was
born, no such notion was understood to have been gravely mooted
till very recently.&nbsp; I doubt whether Mr. Spencer and Mr.
Romanes would accept this even now, when it is put thus
undisguisedly; but this is what Professor Hering and I mean, and
it is the only thing that should be meant, by those who speak of
instinct as inherited memory.&nbsp; Mr Spencer cannot maintain
that these two startling novelties went without saying &ldquo;by
implication&rdquo; from the use of such expressions as
&ldquo;accumulated experiences&rdquo; or &ldquo;experience of the
race.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Chapter III<br />
Mr. Herbert Spencer (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> they ought to have gone or
not, they did not go.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; was first published no one
considered Mr. Spencer to be maintaining the phenomena of
heredity to be in reality phenomena of memory.&nbsp; When, for
example, Professor Ray Lankester first called attention to
Professor Hering&rsquo;s address, he did not understand Mr.
Spencer to be intending this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Professor
Hering,&rdquo; he wrote (<i>Nature</i>, July 13, 1876),
&ldquo;helps us to a comprehensive view of the nature of heredity
and adaptation, by giving us the word &lsquo;memory,&rsquo;
conscious or unconscious, for the continuity of Mr.
Spencer&rsquo;s polar forces or polarities of physiological
units.&rdquo;&nbsp; He evidently found the prominence given to
memory a help to him which he had not derived from reading Mr.
Spencer&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>When, again, he attacked me in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
(March 29, 1884), he spoke of my &ldquo;tardy recognition&rdquo;
of the fact that Professor Hering had preceded me &ldquo;in
treating all manifestations of heredity as a form of
memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Lankester&rsquo;s words could have
no force if he held that any other writer, and much less so well
known a writer as Mr. Spencer, had preceded me in putting forward
the theory in question.</p>
<p>When Mr. Romanes reviewed &ldquo;Unconscious Memory&rdquo; in
<i>Nature</i> (January 27, 1881) the notion of a
&ldquo;race-memory,&rdquo; to use his own words, was still so new
to him that he declared it &ldquo;simply absurd&rdquo; to suppose
that it could &ldquo;possibly be fraught with any benefit to
science,&rdquo; and with him too it was Professor Hering who had
anticipated me in the matter, not Mr. Spencer.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Mental Evolution in Animals&rdquo; (p. 296) he
said that Canon Kingsley, writing in 1867, was the first to
advance the theory that instinct is inherited memory; he could
not have said this if Mr. Spencer had been understood to have
been upholding this view for the last thirty years.</p>
<p>Mr. A. R. Wallace reviewed &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; in
<i>Nature</i> (March 27, 1879), but he did not find the line I
had taken a familiar one, as he surely must have done if it had
followed easily by implication from Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; He called it &ldquo;an ingenious and paradoxical
explanation&rdquo; which was evidently new to him.&nbsp; He
concluded by saying that &ldquo;it might yet afford a clue to
some of the deepest mysteries of the organic world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Mivart, when he reviewed my books on Evolution in
the <i>American Catholic Quarterly Review</i> (July 1881), said,
&ldquo;Mr Butler is not only perfectly logical and consistent in
the startling consequences he deduces from his principles,
but,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Professor Mivart could not have found
my consequences startling if they had already been insisted upon
for many years by one of the best-known writers of the day.</p>
<p>The reviewer of &ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; in the
<i>Saturday Review</i> (March 31, 1879), of whom all I can
venture to say is that he or she is a person whose name carries
weight in matters connected with biology, though he (for brevity)
was in the humour for seeing everything objectionable in me that
could be seen, still saw no Mr. Spencer in me.&nbsp; He
said&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Butler&rsquo;s own particular contribution
to the terminology of Evolution is the phrase two or three times
repeated with some emphasis&rdquo; (I repeated it not two or
three times only, but whenever and wherever I could venture to do
so without wearying the reader beyond endurance) &ldquo;oneness
of personality between parents and offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
writer proceeded to reprobate this in language upon which a
Huxley could hardly improve, but as he declares himself unable to
discover what it means, it may be presumed that the idea of
continued personality between successive generations was new to
him.</p>
<p>When Dr. Francis Darwin called on me a day or two before
&ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; went to the press, he said the
theory which had pleased him more than any he had seen for some
time was one which referred all life to memory; <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> he doubtless intended &ldquo;which
referred all the phenomena of heredity to memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then mentioned Professor Ray Lankester&rsquo;s article in
<i>Nature</i>, of which I had not heard, but he said nothing
about Mr. Spencer, and spoke of the idea as one which had been
quite new to him.</p>
<p>The above names comprise (excluding Mr. Spencer himself)
perhaps those of the best-known writers on evolution that can be
mentioned as now before the public; it is curious that Mr Spencer
should be the only one of them to see any substantial resemblance
between the &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; and Professor
Hering&rsquo;s address and &ldquo;Life and Habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ought, perhaps, to say that Mr. Romanes, writing to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> (March 8, 1884), took a different view of
the value of the theory of inherited memory to the one he took in
1881.</p>
<p>In 1881 he said it was &ldquo;simply absurd&rdquo; to suppose
it could &ldquo;possibly be fraught with any benefit to
science&rdquo; or &ldquo;reveal any truth of profound
significance;&rdquo; in 1884 he said of the same theory, that
&ldquo;it formed the backbone of all the previous literature upon
instinct&rdquo; by Darwin, Spencer, Lewes, Fiske, and Spalding,
&ldquo;not to mention their numerous followers, and is by all of
them elaborately stated as clearly as any theory can be stated in
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few except Mr. Romanes will say this.&nbsp; I grant it ought
to &ldquo;have formed the backbone,&rdquo; &amp;c., and ought
&ldquo;to have been elaborately stated,&rdquo; &amp;c., but when
I wrote &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; neither Mr Romanes nor any
one else understood it to have been even glanced at by more than
a very few, and as for having been &ldquo;elaborately
stated,&rdquo; it had been stated by Professor Hering as
elaborately as it could be stated within the limits of an address
of only twenty-two pages, but with this exception it had never
been stated at all.&nbsp; It is not too much to say that
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; when it first came out, was
considered so startling a paradox that people would not believe
in my desire to be taken seriously, or at any rate were able to
pretend that they thought I was not writing seriously.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes knows this just as well as all must do who keep an
eye on evolution; he himself, indeed, had said (<i>Nature</i>,
January 27, 1881) that so long as I &ldquo;aimed only at
entertaining&rdquo; my &ldquo;readers by such works as
&lsquo;Erewhon&rsquo; and &lsquo;Life and Habit&rsquo;&rdquo; (as
though these books were of kindred character) I was in my proper
sphere.&nbsp; It would be doing too little credit to Mr.
Romanes&rsquo; intelligence to suppose him not to have known when
he said this that &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; was written as
seriously as my subsequent books on evolution, but it suited him
at the moment to join those who professed to consider it another
book of paradoxes such as, I suppose, &ldquo;Erewhon&rdquo; had
been, so he classed the two together.&nbsp; He could not have
done this unless enough people thought, or said they thought, the
books akin, to give colour to his doing so.</p>
<p>One alone of all my reviewers has, to my knowledge, brought
Mr. Spencer against me.&nbsp; This was a writer in the <i>St.
James&rsquo;s Gazette</i> (December 2, 1880).&nbsp; I challenged
him in a letter which appeared (December 8, 1880), and said,
&ldquo;I would ask your reviewer to be kind enough to refer your
readers to those passages of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; which in any direct
intelligible way refer the phenomena of instinct and heredity
generally, to memory on the part of offspring of the action it
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> took in the persons of its
forefathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reviewer made no reply, and I
concluded, as I have since found correctly, that he could not
find the passages.</p>
<p>True, in his &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; (vol. ii.
p. 195) Mr. Spencer says that we have only to expand the doctrine
that all intelligence is acquired through experience &ldquo;so as
to make it include with the experience of each individual the
experiences of all ancestral individuals,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
This is all very good, but it is much the same as saying,
&ldquo;We have only got to stand on our heads and we shall be
able to do so and so.&rdquo;&nbsp; We did not see our way to
standing on our heads, and Mr. Spencer did not help us; we had
been accustomed, as I am afraid I must have said <i>usque ad
nauseam</i> already, to lose sight of the physical connection
existing between parents and offspring; we understood from the
marriage service that husband and wife were in a sense one flesh,
but not that parents and children were so also; and without this
conception of the matter, which in its way is just as true as the
more commonly received one, we could not extend the experience of
parents to offspring.&nbsp; It was not in the bond or
<i>nexus</i> of our ideas to consider experience as appertaining
to more than a single individual in the common acceptance of the
term; these two ideas were so closely bound together that
wherever the one went the other went perforce.&nbsp; Here,
indeed, in the very passage of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s just referred
to, the race is throughout regarded as &ldquo;a series of
individuals&rdquo;&mdash;without an attempt to call attention to
that other view, in virtue of which we are able to extend to many
an idea we had been accustomed to confine to one.</p>
<p>In his chapter on Memory, Mr. Spencer certainly approaches the
Heringian view.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;On the one hand, Instinct
may be regarded as a kind of organised memory; on the other,
Memory may be regarded as a kind of incipient instinct&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Principles of Psychology,&rdquo; ed. 2, vol. i. p.
445).&nbsp; Here the ball has fallen into his hands, but if he
had got firm hold of it he could not have written,
&ldquo;Instinct <i>may be</i> regarded as <i>a kind of</i>,
&amp;c.;&rdquo; to us there is neither &ldquo;may be regarded
as&rdquo; nor &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; about it; we require,
&ldquo;Instinct is inherited memory,&rdquo; with an explanation
making it intelligible how memory can come to be inherited at
all.&nbsp; I do not like, again, calling memory &ldquo;a kind of
incipient instinct;&rdquo; as Mr. Spencer puts them the words
have a pleasant antithesis, but &ldquo;instinct is inherited
memory&rdquo; covers all the ground, and to say that memory is
inherited instinct is surplusage.</p>
<p>Nor does he stick to it long when he says that &ldquo;instinct
is a kind of organised memory,&rdquo; for two pages later he says
that memory, to be memory at all, must be tolerably conscious or
deliberate; he, therefore (vol. i. p. 447), denies that there can
be such a thing as unconscious memory; but without this it is
impossible for us to see instinct as the &ldquo;kind of organised
memory&rdquo; which he has just been calling it, inasmuch as
instinct is notably undeliberate and unreflecting.</p>
<p>A few pages farther on (vol. i. p. 452) he finds himself
driven to unconscious memory after all, and says that
&ldquo;conscious memory passes into unconscious or organic
memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having admitted unconscious memory, he
declares (vol. i. p. 450) that &ldquo;as fast as those
connections among psychical states, which we form in memory, grow
by constant repetition automatic&mdash;they <i>cease to be part
of memory</i>,&rdquo; or, in other words, he again denies that
there can be an unconscious memory.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer doubtless saw that he was involved in
contradiction in terms, and having always understood that
contradictions in terms were very dreadful things&mdash;which, of
course, under some circumstances they are&mdash;thought it well
so to express himself that his readers should be more likely to
push on than dwell on what was before them at the moment.&nbsp; I
should be the last to complain of him merely on the ground that
he could not escape contradiction in terms: who can?&nbsp; When
facts conflict, contradict one another, melt into one another as
the colours of the spectrum so insensibly that none can say where
one begins and the other ends, contradictions in terms become
first fruits of thought and speech.&nbsp; They are the basis of
intellectual consciousness, in the same way that a physical
obstacle is the basis of physical sensation.&nbsp; No opposition,
no sensation, applies as much to the psychical as to the physical
kingdom, as soon as these two have got well above the horizon of
our thoughts and can be seen as two.&nbsp; No contradiction, no
consciousness; no cross, no crown; contradictions are the very
small deadlocks without which there is no going; going is our
sense of a succession of small impediments or deadlocks; it is a
succession of cutting Gordian knots, which on a small scale
please or pain as the case may be; on a larger, give an ecstasy
of pleasure, or shock to the extreme of endurance; and on a still
larger, kill whether they be on the right side or the
wrong.&nbsp; Nature, as I said in &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo;
hates that any principle should breed hermaphroditically, but
will give to each an helpmeet for it which shall cross it and be
the undoing of it; and in the undoing, do; and in the doing,
undo, and so <i>ad infinitum</i>.&nbsp; Cross-fertilisation is
just as necessary for continued fertility of ideas as for that of
organic life, and the attempt to frown this or that down merely
on the ground that it involves contradiction in terms, without at
the same time showing that the contradiction is on a larger scale
than healthy thought can stomach, argues either small sense or
small sincerity on the part of those who make it.&nbsp; The
contradictions employed by Mr. Spencer are objectionable, not on
the ground of their being contradictions at all, but on the
ground of their being blinked, and used unintelligently.</p>
<p>But though it is not possible for any one to get a clear
conception of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s meaning, we may say with more
confidence what it was that he did not mean.&nbsp; He did not
mean to make memory the keystone of his system; he has none of
that sense of the unifying, binding force of memory which
Professor Hering has so well expressed, nor does he show any
signs of perceiving the far-reaching consequences that ensue if
the phenomena of heredity are considered as phenomena of
memory.&nbsp; Thus, when he is dealing with the phenomena of old
age (vol. i. p. 538, ed. 2) he does not ascribe them to lapse and
failure of memory, nor surmise the principle underlying
longevity.&nbsp; He never mentions memory in connection with
heredity without presently saying something which makes us
involuntarily think of a man missing an easy catch at cricket; it
is only rarely, however, that he connects the two at all.&nbsp; I
have only been able to find the word &ldquo;inherited&rdquo; or
any derivative of the verb &ldquo;to inherit&rdquo; in connection
with memory once in all the 1300 long pages of the
&ldquo;Principles of Psychology.&rdquo;&nbsp; It occurs in vol
ii. p. 200, 2d ed., where the words stand, &ldquo;Memory,
inherited or acquired.&rdquo;&nbsp; I submit that this was
unintelligible when Mr. Spencer wrote it, for want of an
explanation which he never gave; I submit, also, that he could
not have left it unexplained, nor yet as an unrepeated expression
not introduced till late in his work, if he had had any idea of
its pregnancy.</p>
<p>At any rate, whether he intended to imply what he now implies
that he intended to imply (for Mr. Spencer, like the late Mr.
Darwin, is fond of qualifying phrases), I have shown that those
most able and willing to understand him did not take him to mean
what he now appears anxious to have it supposed that he
meant.&nbsp; Surely, moreover, if he had meant it he would have
spoken sooner, when he saw his meaning had been missed.&nbsp; I
can, however, have no hesitation in saying that if I had known
the &ldquo;Principles of Psychology&rdquo; earlier, as well as I
know the work now, I should have used it largely.</p>
<p>It may be interesting, before we leave Mr. Spencer, to see
whether he even now assigns to continued personality and memory
the place assigned to it by Professor Hering and myself.&nbsp; I
will therefore give the concluding words of the letter to the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> already referred to, in which he tells us
to stand aside.&nbsp; He writes &ldquo;I still hold that
inheritance of functionally produced modifications is the chief
factor throughout the higher stages of organic evolution, bodily
as well as mental (see &lsquo;Principles of Biology,&rsquo; i.
166), while I recognise the truth that throughout the lower
stages survival of the fittest is the chief factor, and in the
lowest the almost exclusive factor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the same confused and confusing utterance which Mr.
Spencer has been giving us any time this thirty years.&nbsp;
According to him the fact that variations can be inherited and
accumulated has less to do with the first development of organic
life, than the fact that if a square organism happens to get into
a square hole, it will live longer and more happily than a square
organism which happens to get into a round one; he declares
&ldquo;the survival of the fittest&rdquo;&mdash;and this is
nothing but the fact that those who &ldquo;fit&rdquo; best into
their surroundings will live longest and most
comfortably&mdash;to have more to do with the development of the
am&oelig;ba into, we will say, a mollusc than heredity
itself.&nbsp; True, &ldquo;inheritance of functionally produced
modifications&rdquo; is allowed to be the chief factor throughout
the &ldquo;higher stages of organic evolution,&rdquo; but it has
very little to do in the lower; in these &ldquo;the almost
exclusive factor&rdquo; is not heredity, or inheritance, but
&ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course we know that Mr. Spencer does not believe this; of
course, also, all who are fairly well up in the history of the
development theory will see why Mr. Spencer has attempted to draw
this distinction between the &ldquo;factors&rdquo; of the
development of the higher and lower forms of life; but no matter
how or why Mr. Spencer has been led to say what he has, he has no
business to have said it.&nbsp; What can we think of a writer
who, after so many years of writing upon his subject, in a
passage in which he should make his meaning doubly clear,
inasmuch as he is claiming ground taken by other writers,
declares that though hereditary use and disuse, or, to use his
own words, &ldquo;the inheritance of functionally produced
modifications,&rdquo; is indeed very important in connection with
the development of the higher forms of life, yet heredity itself
has little or nothing to do with that of the lower?&nbsp;
Variations, whether produced functionally or not, can only be
perpetuated and accumulated because they can be
inherited;&mdash;and this applies just as much to the lower as to
the higher forms of life; the question which Professor Hering and
I have tried to answer is, &ldquo;How comes it that anything can
be inherited at all?&nbsp; In virtue of what power is it that
offspring can repeat and improve upon the performances of their
parents?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our answer was, &ldquo;Because in a very
valid sense, though not perhaps in the most usually understood,
there is continued personality and an abiding memory between
successive generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; How does Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
confession of faith touch this?&nbsp; If any meaning can be
extracted from his words, he is no more supporting this view now
than he was when he wrote the passages he has adduced to show
that he was supporting it thirty years ago; but after all no
coherent meaning can be got out of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
letter&mdash;except, of course, that Professor Hering and myself
are to stand aside.&nbsp; I have abundantly shown that I am very
ready to do this in favour of Professor Hering, but see no reason
for admitting Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s claim to have been among the
forestallers of &ldquo;Life and Habit.&rdquo;</p>

Mr. Romanes&rsquo; &ldquo;Mental Evolution in Animals&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Without</span> raising the unprofitable
question how Mr. Romanes, in spite of the indifference with which
he treated the theory of Inherited Memory in 1881, came, in 1883,
to be sufficiently imbued with a sense of its importance, I still
cannot afford to dispense with the weight of his authority, and
in this chapter will show how closely he not infrequently
approaches the Heringian position.</p>
<p>Thus, he says that the analogies between the memory with which
we are familiar in daily life and hereditary memory &ldquo;are so
numerous and precise&rdquo; as to justify us in considering them
to be of essentially the same kind. <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>Again, he says that although the memory of milk shown by
new-born infants is &ldquo;at all events in large part
hereditary, it is none the less memory&rdquo; of a certain kind.
<a name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c"
class="citation">[52c]</a></p>
<p>Two lines lower down he writes of &ldquo;hereditary memory or
instinct,&rdquo; thereby implying that instinct is
&ldquo;hereditary memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes no
essential difference,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;whether the past
sensation was actually experienced by the individual itself, or
bequeathed it, so to speak, by its ancestors. <a
name="citation52d"></a><a href="#footnote52d"
class="citation">[52d]</a>&nbsp; For it makes no essential
difference whether the nervous changes . . . were occasioned
during the life-time of the individual or during that of the
species, and afterwards impressed by heredity on the
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lower down on the same page he writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As showing how close is the connection between
hereditary memory and instinct,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>And on the following page:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this shows how closely the phenomena of hereditary
memory are related to those of individual memory: at this stage .
. . it is practically impossible to disentangle the effects of
hereditary memory from those of the individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another point which we have here to consider is the
part which heredity has played in forming the perceptive faculty
of the individual prior to its own experience.&nbsp; We have
already seen that heredity plays an important part in forming
memory of ancestral experiences, and thus it is that many animals
come into the world with their power of perception already
largely developed.&nbsp; The wealth of ready-formed information,
and therefore of ready-made powers of perception, with which many
newly-born or newly-hatched animals are provided, is so great and
so precise that it scarcely requires to be supplemented by the
subsequent experience of the individual.&rdquo; <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a></p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instincts probably owe their origin and development to
one or other of the two principles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I.&nbsp; The first mode of origin consists in natural
selection or survival of the fittest, continuously preserving
actions, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;II.&nbsp; The second mode of origin is as
follows:&mdash;By the effects of habit in successive generations,
actions which were originally intelligent become as it were
stereotyped into permanent instincts.&nbsp; Just as in the
lifetime of the individual adjustive actions which were
originally intelligent may by frequent repetition become
automatic, so in the lifetime of species actions originally
intelligent may by frequent repetition and heredity so write
their effects on the nervous system that the latter is prepared,
even before individual experience, to perform adjustive actions
mechanically which in previous generations were performed
intelligently.&nbsp; This mode of origin of instincts has been
appropriately called (by Lewes&mdash;see &ldquo;Problems of Life
and Mind&rdquo; <a name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a>) the &lsquo;lapsing of
intelligence.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a></p>
<p>I may say in passing that in spite of the great stress laid by
Mr. Romanes both in his &ldquo;Mental Evolution in Animals&rdquo;
and in his letters to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in March 1884, on
Natural Selection as an originator and developer of instinct, he
very soon afterwards let the Natural Selection part of the story
go as completely without saying as I do myself, or as Mr. Darwin
did during the later years of his life.&nbsp; Writing to
<i>Nature</i>, April 10, 1884, he said: &ldquo;To deny <i>that
experience in the course of successive generations is the source
of instinct</i>, is not to meet by way of argument the enormous
mass of evidence which goes to prove <i>that this is the
case</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, then, instinct is referred, without
reservation, to &ldquo;experience in successive
generations,&rdquo; and this is nonsense unless explained as
Professor Hering and I explain it.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes&rsquo;
words, in fact, amount to an unqualified acceptance of the
chapter &ldquo;Instinct as Inherited Memory&rdquo; given in
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; of which Mr. Romanes in March 1884
wrote in terms which it is not necessary to repeat.</p>
<p>Later on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;practice makes perfect&rsquo; is a matter,
as I have previously said, of daily observation.&nbsp; Whether we
regard a juggler, a pianist, or a billiard-player, a child
learning his lesson or an actor his part by frequently repeating
it, or a thousand other illustrations of the same process, we see
at once that there is truth in the cynical definition of a man as
a &lsquo;bundle of habits.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the same, of course,
is true of animals.&rdquo; <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a></p>
<p>From this Mr. Romanes goes on to show &ldquo;that automatic
actions and conscious habits may be inherited,&rdquo; <a
name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a> and in the course of doing this
contends that &ldquo;instincts may be lost by disuse, and
conversely that they may be acquired as instincts by the
hereditary transmission of ancestral experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another page Mr. Romanes says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now turn to the second of these two assumptions,
viz., that some at least among migratory birds must possess, by
inheritance alone, a very precise knowledge of the particular
direction to be pursued.&nbsp; It is without question an
astonishing fact that a young cuckoo should be prompted to leave
its foster parents at a particular season of the year, and
without any guide to show the course previously taken by its own
parents, but this is a fact which must be met by any theory of
instinct which aims at being complete.&nbsp; Now upon our own
theory it can only be met by taking it to be due to inherited
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little lower Mr. Romanes says: &ldquo;Of what kind, then, is
the inherited memory on which the young cuckoo (if not also other
migratory birds) depends?&nbsp; We can only answer, of the same
kind, whatever this may be, as that upon which the old bird
depends.&rdquo; <a name="citation55c"></a><a href="#footnote55c"
class="citation">[55c]</a></p>
<p>I have given above most of the more marked passages which I
have been able to find in Mr. Romanes&rsquo; book which attribute
instinct to memory, and which admit that there is no fundamental
difference between the kind of memory with which we are all
familiar and hereditary memory as transmitted from one generation
to another.</p>
<p>But throughout his work there are passages which suggest,
though less obviously, the same inference.</p>
<p>The passages I have quoted show that Mr. Romanes is upholding
the same opinions as Professor Hering&rsquo;s and my own, but
their effect and tendency is more plain here than in Mr
Romanes&rsquo; own book, where they are overlaid by nearly 400
long pages of matter which is not always easy of
comprehension.</p>
<p>Moreover, at the same time that I claim the weight of Mr.
Romanes&rsquo; authority, I am bound to admit that I do not find
his support satisfactory.&nbsp; The late Mr. Darwin
himself&mdash;whose mantle seems to have fallen more especially
and particularly on Mr. Romanes&mdash;could not contradict
himself more hopelessly than Mr. Romanes often does.&nbsp; Indeed
in one of the very passages I have quoted in order to show that
Mr. Romanes accepts the phenomena of heredity as phenomena of
memory, he speaks of &ldquo;heredity as playing an important part
<i>in forming memory</i> of ancestral experiences;&rdquo; so
that, whereas I want him to say that the phenomena of heredity
are due to memory, he will have it that the memory is due to the
heredity, which seems to me absurd.</p>
<p>Over and over again Mr. Romanes insists that it is heredity
which does this or that.&nbsp; Thus it is &ldquo;<i>heredity with
natural selection which adapt</i> the anatomical plan of the
ganglia.&rdquo; <a name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a>&nbsp; It is heredity which impresses
nervous changes on the individual. <a name="citation56b"></a><a
href="#footnote56b" class="citation">[56b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In
the lifetime of species actions originally intelligent may by
frequent repetition and heredity,&rdquo; &amp;c.; <a
name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a> but he nowhere tells us what heredity
is any more than Messrs. Herbert Spencer, Darwin, and Lewes have
done.&nbsp; This, however, is exactly what Professor Hering, whom
I have unwittingly followed, does.&nbsp; He resolves all
phenomena of heredity, whether in respect of body or mind, into
phenomena of memory.&nbsp; He says in effect, &ldquo;A man grows
his body as he does, and a bird makes her nest as she does,
because both man and bird remember having grown body and made
nest as they now do, or very nearly so, on innumerable past
occasions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thus, as I have said on an earlier
page, reduces life from an equation of say 100 unknown quantities
to one of 99 only by showing that heredity and memory, two of the
original 100 unknown quantities, are in reality part of one and
the same thing.</p>
<p>That he is right Mr. Romanes seems to me to admit, though in a
very unsatisfactory way.</p>
<p>What, for example, can be more unsatisfactory than the
following?&mdash;Mr. Romanes says that the most fundamental
principle of mental operation is that of memory, and that this
&ldquo;is the <i>conditio sine qu&acirc; non</i> of all mental
life&rdquo; (page 35).</p>
<p>I do not understand Mr. Romanes to hold that there is any
living being which has no mind at all, and I do understand him to
admit that development of body and mind are closely
interdependent.</p>
<p>If, then, &ldquo;the most fundamental principle&rdquo; of mind
is memory, it follows that memory enters also as a fundamental
principle into development of body.&nbsp; For mind and body are
so closely connected that nothing can enter largely into the one
without correspondingly affecting the other.</p>
<p>On a later page Mr. Romanes speaks point-blank of the new-born
child as &ldquo;<i>embodying</i> the results of a great mass of
<i>hereditary experience</i>&rdquo; (p. 77), so that what he is
driving at can be collected by those who take trouble, but is not
seen until we call up from our own knowledge matter whose
relevancy does not appear on the face of it, and until we connect
passages many pages asunder, the first of which may easily be
forgotten before we reach the second.&nbsp; There can be no
doubt, however, that Mr. Romanes does in reality, like Professor
Hering and myself, regard development, whether of mind or body,
as due to memory, for it is now pretty generally seen to be
nonsense to talk about &ldquo;hereditary experience&rdquo; or
&ldquo;hereditary memory&rdquo; if anything else is intended.</p>
<p>I have said above that on page 113 of his recent work Mr.
Romanes declares the analogies between the memory with which we
are familiar in daily life, and hereditary memory, to be
&ldquo;so numerous and precise&rdquo; as to justify us in
considering them as of one and the same kind.</p>
<p>This is certainly his meaning, but, with the exception of the
words within inverted commas, it is not his language.&nbsp; His
own words are these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Profound, however, as our ignorance unquestionably is
concerning the physical substratum of memory, I think we are at
least justified in regarding this substratum as the same both in
ganglionic or organic, and in the conscious or psychological
memory, seeing that the analogies between them are so numerous
and precise.&nbsp; Consciousness is but an adjunct which arises
when the physical processes, owing to infrequency of repetition,
complexity of operation, or other causes, involve what I have
before called ganglionic friction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I submit that I have correctly translated Mr. Romanes&rsquo;
meaning, and also that we have a right to complain of his not
saying what he has to say in words which will involve less
&ldquo;ganglionic friction&rdquo; on the part of the reader.</p>
<p>Another example may be found on p. 43 of Mr. Romanes&rsquo;
book.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lastly,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;just as
innumerable special mechanisms of muscular co-ordinations are
found to be inherited, innumerable special associations of ideas
are found to be the same, and in one case as in the other the
strength of the organically imposed connection is found to bear a
direct proportion to the frequency with which in the history of
the species it has occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes is here intending what the reader will find
insisted on on p. 51 of &ldquo;Life and Habit;&rdquo; but how
difficult he has made what could have been said intelligibly
enough, if there had been nothing but the reader&rsquo;s comfort
to be considered.&nbsp; Unfortunately that seems to have been by
no means the only thing of which Mr. Romanes was thinking, or
why, after implying and even saying over and over again that
instinct is inherited habit due to inherited memory, should he
turn sharply round on p. 297 and praise Mr. Darwin for trying to
snuff out &ldquo;the well-known doctrine of inherited habit as
advanced by Lamarck&rdquo;?&nbsp; The answer is not far to
seek.&nbsp; It is because Mr. Romanes did not merely want to tell
us all about instinct, but wanted also, if I may use a homely
metaphor, to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare at one
and the same time.</p>
<p>I remember saying that if the late Mr. Darwin &ldquo;had told
us what the earlier evolutionists said, why they said it, wherein
he differed from them, and in what way he proposed to set them
straight, he would have taken a course at once more agreeable
with usual practice, and more likely to remove misconception from
his own mind and from those of his readers.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; This I have no doubt was one of
the passages which made Mr. Romanes so angry with me.&nbsp; I can
find no better words to apply to Mr. Romanes himself.&nbsp; He
knows perfectly well what others have written about the
connection between heredity and memory, and he knows no less well
that so far as he is intelligible at all he is taking the same
view that they have taken.&nbsp; If he had begun by saying what
they had said, and had then improved on it, I for one should have
been only too glad to be improved upon.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes has spoiled his book just because this plain
old-fashioned method of procedure was not good enough for
him.&nbsp; One-half the obscurity which makes his meaning so hard
to apprehend is due to exactly the same cause as that which has
ruined so much of the late Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work&mdash;I mean
to a desire to appear to be differing altogether from others with
whom he knew himself after all to be in substantial
agreement.&nbsp; He adopts, but (probably quite unconsciously) in
his anxiety to avoid appearing to adopt, he obscures what he is
adopting.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is Mr. Romanes&rsquo; definition of
instinct:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is reflex action into which there is imported
the element of consciousness.&nbsp; The term is therefore a
generic one, comprising all those faculties of mind which are
concerned in conscious and adaptive action, antecedent to
individual experience, without necessary knowledge of the
relation between means employed and ends attained, but similarly
performed under similar and frequently recurring circumstances by
all the individuals of the same species.&rdquo; <a
name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a></p>
<p>If Mr. Romanes would have been content to build frankly upon
Professor Hering&rsquo;s foundation, the soundness of which he
has elsewhere abundantly admitted, he might have said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is knowledge or habit acquired in past
generations&mdash;the new generation remembering what happened to
it before it parted company with the old.&nbsp; More briefly,
Instinct is inherited memory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he might have
added a rider&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a habit is acquired as a new one, during any given
lifetime, it is not an instinct.&nbsp; If having been acquired in
one lifetime it is transmitted to offspring, it is an instinct in
the offspring, though it was not an instinct in the parent.&nbsp;
If the habit is transmitted partially, it must be considered as
partly instinctive and partly acquired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is easy; it tells people how they may test any action so
as to know what they ought to call it; it leaves well alone by
avoiding all such debatable matters as reflex action,
consciousness, intelligence, purpose, knowledge of purpose,
&amp;c.; it both introduces the feature of inheritance which is
the one mainly distinguishing instinctive from so-called
intelligent actions, and shows the manner in which these last
pass into the first, that is to say, by way of memory and
habitual repetition; finally it points the fact that the new
generation is not to be looked upon as a new thing, but (as Dr.
Erasmus Darwin long since said <a name="citation61a"></a><a
href="#footnote61a" class="citation">[61a]</a>) as &ldquo;a
branch or elongation&rdquo; of the one immediately preceding
it.</p>
<p>In Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s case it is hardly possible to exaggerate
the waste of time, money and trouble that has been caused, by his
not having been content to appear as descending with modification
like other people from those who went before him.&nbsp; It will
take years to get the evolution theory out of the mess in which
Mr. Darwin has left it.&nbsp; He was heir to a discredited truth;
he left behind him an accredited fallacy.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes, if
he is not stopped in time, will get the theory connecting
heredity and memory into just such another muddle as Mr. Darwin
has got evolution, for surely the writer who can talk about
&ldquo;<i>heredity being able to work up</i> the faculty of
homing into the instinct of migration,&rdquo; <a
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a> or of &ldquo;the principle of
(natural) selection combining with that of lapsing intelligence
to the formation of a joint result,&rdquo; <a
name="citation61c"></a><a href="#footnote61c"
class="citation">[61c]</a> is little likely to depart from the
usual methods of scientific procedure with advantage either to
himself or any one else.&nbsp; Fortunately Mr. Romanes is not Mr.
Darwin, and though he has certainly got Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
mantle, and got it very much too, it will not on Mr.
Romanes&rsquo; shoulders hide a good deal that people were not
going to observe too closely while Mr. Darwin wore it.</p>
<p>I ought to say that the late Mr. Darwin appears himself
eventually to have admitted the soundness of the theory
connecting heredity and memory.&nbsp; Mr. Romanes quotes a letter
written by Mr. Darwin in the last year of his life, in which he
speaks of an intelligent action gradually becoming
&ldquo;<i>instinctive</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>memory transmitted
from one generation to another</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>Briefly, the stages of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s opinion upon the
subject of hereditary memory are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1859.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be <i>the most serious error</i>
to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been
acquired by habit in one generation and transmitted by
inheritance to succeeding generations.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; And this more especially applies
to the instincts of many ants.</p>
<p>1876.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be a <i>serious error</i> to
suppose,&rdquo; &amp;c., as before. <a name="citation62c"></a><a
href="#footnote62c" class="citation">[62c]</a></p>
<p>1881.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should remember <i>what a mass of
inherited knowledge</i> is crowded into the minute brain of a
worker ant.&rdquo; <a name="citation62d"></a><a
href="#footnote62d" class="citation">[62d]</a></p>
<p>1881 or 1882.&nbsp; Speaking of a given habitual action Mr.
Darwin writes: &ldquo;It does not seem to me at all incredible
that this action [and why this more than any other habitual
action?] should then become instinctive:&rdquo; i.e., <i>memory
transmitted from one generation to another</i>. <a
name="citation62e"></a><a href="#footnote62e"
class="citation">[62e]</a></p>
<p>And yet in 1839, or thereabouts, Mr. Darwin had pretty nearly
grasped the conception from which until the last year or two of
his life he so fatally strayed; for in his contribution to the
volumes giving an account of the voyages of the <i>Adventure</i>
and <i>Beagle</i>, he wrote: &ldquo;Nature by making habit
omnipotent and its effects hereditary, has fitted the Fuegian for
the climate and productions of his country&rdquo; (p. 237).</p>
<p>What is the secret of the long departure from the simple
common-sense view of the matter which he took when he was a young
man?&nbsp; I imagine simply what I have referred to in the
preceding chapter, over-anxiety to appear to be differing from
his grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck.</p>
<p>I believe I may say that Mr. Darwin before he died not only
admitted the connection between memory and heredity, but came
also to see that he must readmit that design in organism which he
had so many years opposed.&nbsp; For in the preface to Hermann
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fertilisation of Flowers,&rdquo; <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> which bears a date only a very few
weeks prior to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s death, I find him
saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Design in nature has for a long time deeply
interested many men, and though the subject must now be looked at
from a somewhat different point of view from what was formerly
the case, it is not on that account rendered less
interesting.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is mused forth as a general gnome,
and may mean anything or nothing: the writer of the letterpress
under the hieroglyph in Old Moore&rsquo;s Almanac could not be
more guarded; but I think I know what it does mean.</p>
<p>I cannot, of course, be sure; Mr. Darwin did not probably
intend that I should; but I assume with confidence that whether
there is design in organism or no, there is at any rate design in
this passage of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This, we may be sure,
is not a fortuitous variation; and, moreover, it is introduced
for some reason which made Mr. Darwin think it worth while to go
out of his way to introduce it.&nbsp; It has no fitness in its
connection with Hermann M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s book, for what little
Hermann M&uuml;ller says about teleology at all is to condemn it;
why, then, should Mr. Darwin muse here of all places in the world
about the interest attaching to design in organism?&nbsp; Neither
has the passage any connection with the rest of the
preface.&nbsp; There is not another word about design, and even
here Mr. Darwin seems mainly anxious to face both ways, and pat
design as it were on the head while not committing himself to any
proposition which could be disputed.</p>
<p>The explanation is sufficiently obvious.&nbsp; Mr Darwin
wanted to hedge.&nbsp; He saw that the design which his works had
been mainly instrumental in pitchforking out of organisms no less
manifestly designed than a burglar&rsquo;s jemmy is designed, had
nevertheless found its way back again, and that though, as I
insisted in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Unconscious Memory,&rdquo; it must now be placed within
the organism instead of outside it, as &ldquo;was formerly the
case,&rdquo; it was not on that account any the
less&mdash;design, as well as interesting.</p>
<p>I should like to have seen Mr. Darwin say this more
explicitly.&nbsp; Indeed I should have liked to have seen Mr.
Darwin say anything at all about the meaning of which there could
be no mistake, and without contradicting himself elsewhere; but
this was not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>In passing I will give another example of Mr Darwin&rsquo;s
manner when he did not quite dare even to hedge.&nbsp; It is to
be found in the preface which he wrote to Professor
Weismann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Studies in the Theory of Descent,&rdquo;
published in 1881.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several distinguished naturalists,&rdquo; says Mr.
Darwin, &ldquo;maintain with much confidence that organic beings
tend to vary and to rise in the scale, independently of the
conditions to which they and their progenitors have been exposed;
whilst others maintain that all variation is due to such
exposure, though the manner in which the environment acts is as
yet quite unknown.&nbsp; At the present time there is hardly any
question in biology of more importance than this of the nature
and causes of variability; and the reader will find in the
present work an able discussion on the whole subject, which will
probably lead him to pause before he admits the existence of an
innate tendency to perfectibility&rdquo;&mdash;or towards
<i>being able to be perfected</i>.</p>
<p>I could find no able discussion upon the whole subject in
Professor Weismann&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; There was a little
something here and there, but not much.</p>
<p>It may be expected that I should say something here about Mr.
Romanes&rsquo; latest contribution to biology&mdash;I mean his
theory of physiological selection, of which the two first
instalments have appeared in <i>Nature</i> just as these pages
are leaving my hands, and many months since the foregoing, and
most of the following chapters were written.&nbsp; I admit to
feeling a certain sense of thankfulness that they did not appear
earlier; as it is, my book is too far advanced to be capable of
further embryonic change, and this must be my excuse for saying
less about Mr. Romanes&rsquo; theory than I might perhaps
otherwise do.&nbsp; I cordially, however, agree with the
<i>Times</i>, which says that &ldquo;Mr. George Romanes appears
to be the biological investigator on whom the mantle of Mr.
Darwin has most conspicuously descended&rdquo; (August 16,
1886).&nbsp; Mr. Romanes is just the person whom the late Mr.
Darwin would select to carry on his work, and Mr. Darwin was just
the kind of person towards whom Mr. Romanes would find himself
instinctively attracted.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i> continues&mdash;&ldquo;The position which Mr.
Romanes takes up is the result of his perception shared by many
evolutionists, that the theory of natural selection is not really
a theory of the origin of species. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; What, then,
becomes of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s most famous work, which was written
expressly to establish natural selection as the main means of
organic modification?&nbsp; &ldquo;The new factor which Mr.
Romanes suggests,&rdquo; continues the <i>Times</i>, &ldquo;is
that at a certain stage of development of varieties in a state of
nature a change takes place in their reproductive systems,
rendering those which differ in some particulars mutually
infertile, and thus the formation of new permanent species takes
place without the swamping effect of free intercrossing. . .
.&nbsp; How his theory can be properly termed one of selection he
fails to make clear.&nbsp; If correct, it is a law or principle
of operation rather than a process of selection.&nbsp; It has
been objected to Mr. Romanes&rsquo; theory that it is the
re-statement of a fact.&nbsp; This objection is less important
than the lack of facts in support of the theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
<i>Times</i>, however, implies it as its opinion that the
required facts will be forthcoming by and by, and that when they
have been found Mr. Romanes&rsquo; suggestion will constitute
&ldquo;the most important addition to the theory of evolution
since the publication of the &lsquo;Origin of
Species.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Considering that the <i>Times</i>
has just implied the main thesis of the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; to be one which does not stand examination, this
is rather a doubtful compliment.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Romanes nor the writer in the <i>Times</i> appears
to perceive that the results which may or may not be supposed to
ensue on choice depend upon what it is that is supposed to be
chosen from; they do not appear to see that though the expression
natural selection must be always more or less objectionable, as
too highly charged with metaphor for purposes of science, there
is nevertheless a natural selection which is open to no other
objection than this, and which, when its metaphorical character
is borne well in mind, may be used without serious risk of error,
whereas natural selection from variations that are mainly
fortuitous is chimerical as well as metaphorical.&nbsp; Both
writers speak of natural selection as though there could not
possibly be any selection in the course of nature, or natural
survival, of any but accidental variations.&nbsp; Thus Mr.
Romanes says: <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The swamping effect of
free inter-crossing upon an individual variation constitutes
perhaps the most formidable difficulty with which <i>the theory
of natural selection</i> is beset.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the writer of
the article in the <i>Times</i> above referred to says: &ldquo;In
truth <i>the theory of natural selection</i> presents many facts
and results which increase rather than diminish the difficulty of
accounting for the existence of species.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
assertion made in each case is true if the Charles-Darwinian
selection from fortuitous variations is intended, but it does not
hold good if the selection is supposed to be made from variations
under which there lies a general principle of wide and abiding
application.&nbsp; It is not likely that a man of Mr.
Romanes&rsquo; antecedents should not be perfectly awake to
considerations so obvious as the foregoing, and I am afraid I am
inclined to consider his whole suggestion as only an attempt upon
the part of the wearer of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mantle to carry on
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>I have seen Professor Hering&rsquo;s theory adopted recently
more unreservedly by Dr. Creighton in his &ldquo;Illustrations of
Unconscious Memory in Disease.&rdquo; <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Creighton avowedly bases his
system on Professor Hering&rsquo;s address, and endorses it; it
is with much pleasure that I have seen him lend the weight of his
authority to the theory that each cell and organ has an
individual memory.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; I
expressed a hope that the opinions it upheld would be found
useful by medical men, and am therefore the more glad to see that
this has proved to be the case.&nbsp; I may perhaps be pardoned
if I quote the passage in &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; to which I
am referring.&nbsp; It runs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the above would seem to hold
as truly about medicine as about politics.&nbsp; We cannot reason
with our cells, for they know so much more&rdquo; (of course I
mean &ldquo;about their own business&rdquo;) &ldquo;than we do,
that they cannot understand us;&mdash;but though we cannot reason
with them, we can find out what they have been most accustomed
to, and what, therefore, they are most likely to expect; we can
see that they get this as far as it is in our power to give it
them, and may then generally leave the rest to them, only bearing
in mind that they will rebel equally against too sudden a change
of treatment and no change at all&rdquo; (p. 305).</p>
<p>Dr. Creighton insists chiefly on the importance of change,
which&mdash;though I did not notice his saying so&mdash;he would
doubtless see as a mode of cross-fertilisation, fraught in all
respects with the same advantages as this, and requiring the same
precautions against abuse; he would not, however, I am sure, deny
that there could be no fertility of good results if too wide a
cross were attempted, so that I may claim the weight of his
authority as supporting both the theory of an unconscious memory
in general, and the particular application of it to medicine
which I had ventured to suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the word &lsquo;memory,&rsquo;&rdquo; he asks,
&ldquo;a real application to unconscious organic phenomena, or do
we use it outside its ancient limits only in a figure of
speech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had thought,&rdquo; he continues later,
&ldquo;that unconscious memory was no more than a metaphor, and
the detailed application of it to these various forms of disease
merely allegorical, I should still have judged it not
unprofitable to represent a somewhat hackneyed class of maladies
in the light of a parable.&nbsp; None of our faculties is more
familiar to us in its workings than the memory, and there is
hardly any force or power in nature which every one knows so well
as the force of habit.&nbsp; To say that a neurotic subject is
like a person with a retentive memory, or that a diathesis
gradually acquired is like an over-mastering habit, is at all
events to make comparisons with things that we all
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For reasons given chiefly in the first chapter, I
conclude that retentiveness, with reproduction, is a single
undivided faculty throughout the whole of our life, whether
mental or bodily, conscious or unconscious; and I claim the
description of a certain class of maladies according to the
phraseology of memory and habit as a real description and not a
figurative.&rdquo; (p. 2.)</p>
<p>As a natural consequence of the foregoing he regards
&ldquo;alterative action&rdquo; as &ldquo;habit-breaking
action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As regards the organism&rsquo;s being guided throughout its
development to maturity by an unconscious memory, Dr. Creighton
says that &ldquo;Professor Bain calls reproduction the acme of
organic complication.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I should prefer to
say,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;the acme of organic implication; for
the reason that the sperm and germ elements are perfectly simple,
having nothing in their form or structure to show for the
marvellous potentialities within them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now come to the application of these considerations
to the doctrine of unconscious memory.&nbsp; If generation is the
acme of organic implicitness, what is its correlative in nature,
what is the acme of organic explicitness?&nbsp; Obviously the
fine flower of consciousness.&nbsp; Generation is implicit
memory, consciousness is explicit memory; generation is potential
memory, consciousness is actual memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not sure that I understand the preceding paragraph as
clearly as I should wish, but having quoted enough to perhaps
induce the reader to turn to Dr. Creighton&rsquo;s book, I will
proceed to the subject indicated in my title.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>Chapter V<br />
Statement of the Question at Issue</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the two points referred to in
the opening sentence of this book&mdash;I mean the connection
between heredity and memory, and the reintroduction of design
into organic modification&mdash;the second is both the more
important and the one which stands most in need of support.&nbsp;
The substantial identity between heredity and memory is becoming
generally admitted; as regards my second point, however, I cannot
flatter myself that I have made much way against the formidable
array of writers on the neo-Darwinian side; I shall therefore
devote the rest of my book as far as possible to this subject
only.&nbsp; Natural selection (meaning by these words the
preservation in the ordinary course of nature of favourable
variations that are supposed to be mainly matters of pure good
luck and in no way arising out of function) has been, to use an
Americanism than which I can find nothing apter, the biggest
biological boom of the last quarter of a century; it is not,
therefore, to be wondered at that Professor Ray Lankester, Mr.
Romanes, Mr. Grant Allen, and others, should show some impatience
at seeing its value as prime means of modification called in
question.&nbsp; Within the last few months, indeed, Mr. Grant
Allen <a name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> and Professor Ray Lankester <a
name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a> in England, and Dr. Ernst Krause <a
name="citation70c"></a><a href="#footnote70c"
class="citation">[70c]</a> in Germany, have spoken and written
warmly in support of the theory of natural selection, and in
opposition to the views taken by myself; if they are not to be
left in possession of the field the sooner they are met the
better.</p>
<p>Stripped of detail the point at issue is this;&mdash;whether
luck or cunning is the fitter to be insisted on as the main means
of organic development.&nbsp; Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck answered
this question in favour of cunning.&nbsp; They settled it in
favour of intelligent perception of the situation&mdash;within,
of course, ever narrower and narrower limits as organism retreats
farther backwards from ourselves&mdash;and persistent effort to
turn it to account.&nbsp; They made this the soul of all
development whether of mind or body.</p>
<p>And they made it, like all other souls, liable to aberration
both for better and worse.&nbsp; They held that some organisms
show more ready wit and <i>savoir faire</i> than others; that
some give more proofs of genius and have more frequent happy
thoughts than others, and that some have even gone through waters
of misery which they have used as wells.</p>
<p>The sheet anchor both of Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck is in good
sense and thrift; still they are aware that money has been
sometimes made by &ldquo;striking oil,&rdquo; and ere now been
transmitted to descendants in spite of the haphazard way in which
it was originally acquired.&nbsp; No speculation, no commerce;
&ldquo;nothing venture, nothing have,&rdquo; is as true for the
development of organic wealth as for that of any other kind, and
neither Erasmus Darwin nor Lamarck hesitated about admitting that
highly picturesque and romantic incidents of developmental
venture do from time to time occur in the race histories even of
the dullest and most dead-level organisms under the name of
&ldquo;sports;&rdquo; but they would hold that even these occur
most often and most happily to those that have persevered in
well-doing for some generations.&nbsp; Unto the organism that
hath is given, and from the organism that hath not is taken away;
so that even &ldquo;sports&rdquo; prove to be only a little off
thrift, which still remains the sheet anchor of the early
evolutionists.&nbsp; They believe, in fact, that more organic
wealth has been made by saving than in any other way.&nbsp; The
race is not in the long run to the phenomenally swift nor the
battle to the phenomenally strong, but to the good average
all-round organism that is alike shy of Radical crotchets and old
world obstructiveness.&nbsp; <i>Festina</i>, but <i>festina
lente</i>&mdash;perhaps as involving so completely the
contradiction in terms which must underlie all
modification&mdash;is the motto they would assign to organism,
and <i>Chi va piano va lontano</i>, they hold to be a maxim as
old, if not as the hills (and they have a hankering even after
these), at any rate as the am&oelig;ba.</p>
<p>To repeat in other words.&nbsp; All enduring forms establish a
<i>modus vivendi</i> with their surroundings.&nbsp; They can do
this because both they and the surroundings are plastic within
certain undefined but somewhat narrow limits.&nbsp; They are
plastic because they can to some extent change their habits, and
changed habit, if persisted in, involves corresponding change,
however slight, in the organs employed; but their plasticity
depends in great measure upon their failure to perceive that they
are moulding themselves.&nbsp; If a change is so great that they
are seriously incommoded by its novelty, they are not likely to
acquiesce in it kindly enough to grow to it, but they will make
no difficulty about the miracle involved in accommodating
themselves to a difference of only two or three per cent. <a
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a></p>
<p>As long as no change exceeds this percentage, and as long,
also, as fresh change does not supervene till the preceding one
is well established, there seems no limit to the amount of
modification which may be accumulated in the course of
generations&mdash;provided, of course, always, that the
modification continues to be in conformity with the instinctive
habits and physical development of the organism in their
collective capacity.&nbsp; Where the change is too great, or
where an organ has been modified cumulatively in some one
direction, until it has reached a development too seriously out
of harmony with the habits of the organism taken collectively,
then the organism holds itself excused from further effort,
throws up the whole concern, and takes refuge in the liquidation
and reconstruction of death.&nbsp; It is only on the
relinquishing of further effort that this death ensues; as long
as effort endures, organisms go on from change to change,
altering and being altered&mdash;that is to say, either killing
themselves piecemeal in deference to the surroundings or killing
the surroundings piecemeal to suit themselves.&nbsp; There is a
ceaseless higgling and haggling, or rather a life-and-death
struggle between these two things as long as life lasts, and one
or other or both have in no small part to re-enter into the womb
from whence they came and be born again in some form which shall
give greater satisfaction.</p>
<p>All change is <i>pro tanto</i> death or <i>pro tanto</i>
birth.&nbsp; Change is the common substratum which underlies both
life and death; life and death are not two distinct things
absolutely antagonistic to one another; in the highest life there
is still much death, and in the most complete death there is
still not a little life.&nbsp; <i>La vie</i>, says Claud Bernard,
<a name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> <i>c&rsquo;est la mort</i>: he might
have added, and perhaps did, <i>et la mort ce n&rsquo;est que la
vie transform&eacute;e</i>.&nbsp; Life and death are the extreme
modes of something which is partly both and wholly neither; this
something is common, ordinary change; solve any change and the
mystery of life and death will be revealed; show why and how
anything becomes ever anything other in any respect than what it
is at any given moment, and there will be little secret left in
any other change.&nbsp; One is not in its ultimate essence more
miraculous that another; it may be more striking&mdash;a greater
<i>congeries</i> of shocks, it may be more credible or more
incredible, but not more miraculous; all change is
<i>qu&acirc;</i> us absolutely incomprehensible and miraculous;
the smallest change baffles the greatest intellect if its
essence, as apart from its phenomena, be inquired into.</p>
<p>But however this may be, all organic change is either a growth
or a dissolution, or a combination of the two.&nbsp; Growth is
the coming together of elements with <i>quasi</i> similar
characteristics.&nbsp; I understand it is believed to be the
coming together of matter in certain states of motion with other
matter in states so nearly similar that the rhythms of the one
coalesce with and hence reinforce the rhythms pre-existing in the
other&mdash;making, rather than marring and undoing them.&nbsp;
Life and growth are an attuning, death and decay are an untuning;
both involve a succession of greater or smaller attunings and
untunings; organic life is &ldquo;the diapason closing full in
man&rdquo;; it is the fulness of a tone that varies in pitch,
quality, and in the harmonics to which it gives rise; it ranges
through every degree of complexity from the endless combinations
of life-and-death within life-and-death which we find in the
mammalia, to the comparative simplicity of the am&oelig;ba.&nbsp;
Death, again, like life, ranges through every degree of
complexity.&nbsp; All pleasant changes are recreative; they are
<i>pro tanto</i> births; all unpleasant changes are wearing, and,
as such, <i>pro tanto</i> deaths, but we can no more exhaust
either wholly of the other, than we can exhaust all the air out
of a receiver; pleasure and pain lurk within one another, as life
in death, and death in life, or as rest and unrest in one
another.</p>
<p>There is no greater mystery in life than in death.&nbsp; We
talk as though the riddle of life only need engage us; this is
not so; death is just as great a miracle as life; the one is two
and two making five, the other is five splitting into two and
two.&nbsp; Solve either, and we have solved the other; they
should be studied not apart, for they are never parted, but
together, and they will tell more tales of one another than
either will tell about itself.&nbsp; If there is one thing which
advancing knowledge makes clearer than another, it is that death
is swallowed up in life, and life in death; so that if the last
enemy that shall be subdued is death, then indeed is our
salvation nearer than what we thought, for in strictness there is
neither life nor death, nor thought nor thing, except as figures
of speech, and as the approximations which strike us for the time
as most convenient.&nbsp; There is neither perfect life nor
perfect death, but a being ever with the Lord only, in the
eternal &phi;&omicron;&rho;&alpha;, or going to and fro and heat
and fray of the universe.&nbsp; When we were young we thought the
one certain thing was that we should one day come to die; now we
know the one certain thing to be that we shall never wholly do
so.&nbsp; <i>Non omnis moriar</i>, says Horace, and &ldquo;I die
daily,&rdquo; says St. Paul, as though a life beyond the grave,
and a death on this side of it, were each some strange thing
which happened to them alone of all men; but who dies absolutely
once for all, and for ever at the hour that is commonly called
that of death, and who does not die daily and hourly?&nbsp; Does
any man in continuing to live from day to day or moment to
moment, do more than continue in a changed body, with changed
feelings, ideas, and aims, so that he lives from moment to moment
only in virtue of a simultaneous dying from moment to moment
also?&nbsp; Does any man in dying do more than, on a larger and
more complete scale, what he has been doing on a small one, as
the most essential factor of his life, from the day that he
became &ldquo;he&rdquo; at all?&nbsp; When the note of life is
struck the harmonics of death are sounded, and so, again, to
strike death is to arouse the infinite harmonics of life that
rise forthwith as incense curling upwards from a censer.&nbsp; If
in the midst of life we are in death, so also in the midst of
death we are in life, and whether we live or whether we die,
whether we like it and know anything about it or no, still we do
it to the Lord&mdash;living always, dying always, and in the Lord
always, the unjust and the just alike, for God is no respecter of
persons.</p>
<p>Consciousness and change, so far as we can watch them, are as
functionally interdependent as mind and matter, or condition and
substance, are&mdash;for the condition of every substance may be
considered as the expression and outcome of its mind.&nbsp; Where
there is consciousness there is change; where there is no change
there is no consciousness; may we not suspect that there is no
change without a <i>pro tanto</i> consciousness however simple
and unspecialised?&nbsp; Change and motion are one, so that we
have substance, feeling, change (or motion), as the ultimate
three-in-one of our thoughts, and may suspect all change, and all
feeling, attendant or consequent, however limited, to be the
interaction of those states which for want of better terms we
call mind and matter.&nbsp; Action may be regarded as a kind of
middle term between mind and matter; it is the throe of thought
and thing, the quivering clash and union of body and soul;
commonplace enough in practice; miraculous, as violating every
canon on which thought and reason are founded, if we theorise
about it, put it under the microscope, and vivisect it.&nbsp; It
is here, if anywhere, that body or substance is guilty of the
contradiction in terms of combining with that which is without
material substance and cannot, therefore, be conceived by us as
passing in and out with matter, till the two become a body
ensouled and a soul embodied.</p>
<p>All body is more or less ensouled.&nbsp; As it gets farther
and farther from ourselves, indeed, we sympathise less with it;
nothing, we say to ourselves, can have intelligence unless we
understand all about it&mdash;as though intelligence in all
except ourselves meant the power of being understood rather than
of understanding.&nbsp; We are intelligent, and no intelligence,
so different from our own as to baffle our powers of
comprehension deserves to be called intelligence at all.&nbsp;
The more a thing resembles ourselves, the more it thinks as we
do&mdash;and thus by implication tells us that we are right, the
more intelligent we think it; and the less it thinks as we do,
the greater fool it must be; if a substance does not succeed in
making it clear that it understands our business, we conclude
that it cannot have any business of its own, much less understand
it, or indeed understand anything at all.&nbsp; But letting this
pass, so far as we are concerned,
&chi;&rho;&eta;&mu;&#940;&tau;&omega;&nu;
&pi;&#940;&nu;&tau;&omega;&nu; &mu;&#941;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;
&#940;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;; we are body
ensouled, and soul embodied, ourselves, nor is it possible for us
to think seriously of anything so unlike ourselves as to consist
either of soul without body, or body without soul.&nbsp;
Unmattered condition, therefore, is as inconceivable by us as
unconditioned matter; and we must hold that all body with which
we can be conceivably concerned is more or less ensouled, and all
soul, in like manner, more or less embodied.&nbsp; Strike either
body or soul&mdash;that is to say, effect either a physical or a
mental change, and the harmonics of the other sound.&nbsp; So
long as body is minded in a certain way&mdash;so long, that is to
say, as it feels, knows, remembers, concludes, and forecasts one
set of things&mdash;it will be in one form; if it assumes a new
one, otherwise than by external violence, no matter how slight
the change may be, it is only through having changed its mind,
through having forgotten and died to some trains of thought, and
having been correspondingly born anew by the adoption of new
ones.&nbsp; What it will adopt depends upon which of the various
courses open to it it considers most to its advantage.</p>
<p>What it will think to its advantage depends mainly on the past
habits of its race.&nbsp; Its past and now invisible lives will
influence its desires more powerfully than anything it may itself
be able to add to the sum of its likes and dislikes;
nevertheless, over and above preconceived opinion and the habits
to which all are slaves, there is a small salary, or, as it were,
agency commission, which each may have for himself, and spend
according to his fancy; from this, indeed, income-tax must be
deducted; still there remains a little margin of individual
taste, and here, high up on this narrow, inaccessible ledge of
our souls, from year to year a breed of not unprolific variations
build where reason cannot reach them to despoil them; for <i>de
gustibus non est disputandum</i>.</p>
<p>Here we are as far as we can go.&nbsp; Fancy, which sometimes
sways so much and is swayed by so little, and which sometimes,
again, is so hard to sway, and moves so little when it is swayed;
whose ways have a method of their own, but are not as our
ways&mdash;fancy, lies on the extreme borderland of the realm
within which the writs of our thoughts run, and extends into that
unseen world wherein they have no jurisdiction.&nbsp; Fancy is as
the mist upon the horizon which blends earth and sky; where,
however, it approaches nearest to the earth and can be reckoned
with, it is seen as melting into desire, and this as giving birth
to design and effort.&nbsp; As the net result and outcome of
these last, living forms grow gradually but persistently into
physical conformity with their own intentions, and become outward
and visible signs of the inward and spiritual faiths, or wants of
faith, that have been most within them.&nbsp; They thus very
gradually, but none the less effectually, design themselves.</p>
<p>In effect, therefore, Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck introduce
uniformity into the moral and spiritual worlds as it was already
beginning to be introduced into the physical.&nbsp; According to
both these writers development has ever been a matter of the same
energy, effort, good sense, and perseverance, as tend to
advancement of life now among ourselves.&nbsp; In essence it is
neither more nor less than this, as the rain-drop which denuded
an ancient formation is of the same kind as that which is
denuding a modern one, though its effect may vary in geometrical
ratio with the effect it has produced already.&nbsp; As we are
extending reason to the lower animals, so we must extend a system
of moral government by rewards and punishments no less surely;
and if we admit that to some considerable extent man is man, and
master of his fate, we should admit also that all organic forms
which are saved at all have been in proportionate degree masters
of their fate too, and have worked out, not only their own
salvation, but their salvation according, in no small measure, to
their own goodwill and pleasure, at times with a light heart, and
at times in fear and trembling.&nbsp; I do not say that Erasmus
Darwin and Lamarck saw all the foregoing as clearly as it is easy
to see it now; what I have said, however, is only the natural
development of their system.</p>

Statement of the Question at Issue (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much for the older view; and now
for the more modern opinion.&nbsp; According to Messrs. Darwin
and Wallace, and ostensibly, I am afraid I should add, a great
majority of our most prominent biologists, the view taken by
Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck is not a sound one.&nbsp; Some
organisms, indeed, are so admirably adapted to their
surroundings, and some organs discharge their functions with so
much appearance of provision, that we are apt to think they must
owe their development to sense of need and consequent
contrivance, but this opinion is fantastic; the appearance of
design is delusive; what we are tempted to see as an accumulated
outcome of desire and cunning, we should regard as mainly an
accumulated outcome of good luck.</p>
<p>Let us take the eye as a somewhat crucial example.&nbsp; It is
a seeing-machine, or thing to see with.&nbsp; So is a telescope;
the telescope in its highest development is a secular
accumulation of cunning, sometimes small, sometimes great;
sometimes applied to this detail of the instrument, and sometimes
to that.&nbsp; It is an admirable example of design;
nevertheless, as I said in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo;
he who made the first rude telescope had probably no idea of any
more perfect form of the instrument than the one he had himself
invented.&nbsp; Indeed, if he had, he would have carried his idea
out in practice.&nbsp; He would have been unable to conceive such
an instrument as Lord Rosse&rsquo;s; the design, therefore, at
present evidenced by the telescope was not design all on the part
of one and the same person.&nbsp; Nor yet was it unmixed with
chance; many a detail has been doubtless due to an accident or
coincidence which was forthwith seized and made the best
of.&nbsp; Luck there always has been and always will be, until
all brains are opened, and all connections made known, but luck
turned to account becomes design; there is, indeed, if things are
driven home, little other design than this.&nbsp; The telescope,
therefore, is an instrument designed in all its parts for the
purpose of seeing, and, take it all round, designed with singular
skill.</p>
<p>Looking at the eye, we are at first tempted to think that it
must be the telescope over again, only more so; we are tempted to
see it as something which has grown up little by little from
small beginnings, as the result of effort well applied and handed
down from generation to generation, till, in the vastly greater
time during which the eye has been developing as compared with
the telescope, a vastly more astonishing result has been arrived
at.&nbsp; We may indeed be tempted to think this, but, according
to Mr. Darwin, we should be wrong.&nbsp; Design had a great deal
to do with the telescope, but it had nothing or hardly anything
whatever to do with the eye.&nbsp; The telescope owes its
development to cunning, the eye to luck, which, it would seem, is
so far more cunning than cunning that one does not quite
understand why there should be any cunning at all.&nbsp; The main
means of developing the eye was, according to Mr. Darwin, not use
as varying circumstances might direct with consequent slow
increase of power and an occasional happy flight of genius, but
natural selection.&nbsp; Natural selection, according to him,
though not the sole, is still the most important means of its
development and modification. <a name="citation81a"></a><a
href="#footnote81a" class="citation">[81a]</a>&nbsp; What, then,
is natural selection?</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin has told us this on the title-page of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; He there defines it as
&ldquo;The Preservation of Favoured Races;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Favoured&rdquo; is &ldquo;Fortunate,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fortunate&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucky;&rdquo; it is plain,
therefore, that with Mr. Darwin natural selection comes to
&ldquo;The Preservation of Lucky Races,&rdquo; and that he
regarded luck as the most important feature in connection with
the development even of so apparently purposive an organ as the
eye, and as the one, therefore, on which it was most proper to
insist.&nbsp; And what is luck but absence of intention or
design?&nbsp; What, then, can Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s title-page
amount to when written out plainly, but to an assertion that the
main means of modification has been the preservation of races
whose variations have been unintentional, that is to say, not
connected with effort or intention, devoid of mind or meaning,
fortuitous, spontaneous, accidental, or whatever kindred word is
least disagreeable to the reader?&nbsp; It is impossible to
conceive any more complete denial of mind as having had anything
to do with organic development, than is involved in the
title-page of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; when its
doubtless carefully considered words are studied&mdash;nor, let
me add, is it possible to conceive a title-page more likely to
make the reader&rsquo;s attention rest much on the main doctrine
of evolution, and little, to use the words now most in vogue
concerning it, on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own &ldquo;distinctive
feature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the full title of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; is, &ldquo;On the origin of
species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of
favoured races in the struggle for life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
significance of the expansion of the title escaped the greater
number of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s readers.&nbsp; Perhaps it ought not
to have done so, but we certainly failed to catch it.&nbsp; The
very words themselves escaped us&mdash;and yet there they were
all the time if we had only chosen to look.&nbsp; We thought the
book was called &ldquo;On the Origin of Species,&rdquo; and so it
was on the outside; so it was also on the inside fly-leaf; so it
was on the title-page itself as long as the most prominent type
was used; the expanded title was only given once, and then in
smaller type; so the three big &ldquo;Origins of Species&rdquo;
carried us with them to the exclusion of the rest.</p>
<p>The short and working title, &ldquo;On the Origin of
Species,&rdquo; in effect claims descent with modification
generally; the expanded and technically true title only claims
the discovery that luck is the main means of organic
modification, and this is a very different matter.&nbsp; The book
ought to have been entitled, &ldquo;On Natural Selection, or the
preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life, as the
main means of the origin of species;&rdquo; this should have been
the expanded title, and the short title should have been
&ldquo;On Natural Selection.&rdquo;&nbsp; The title would not
then have involved an important difference between its working
and its technical forms, and it would have better fulfilled the
object of a title, which is, of course, to give, as far as may
be, the essence of a book in a nutshell.&nbsp; We learn on the
authority of Mr. Darwin himself <a name="citation83a"></a><a
href="#footnote83a" class="citation">[83a]</a> that the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; was originally intended to bear
the title &ldquo;Natural Selection;&rdquo; nor is it easy to see
why the change should have been made if an accurate expression of
the contents of the book was the only thing which Mr. Darwin was
considering.&nbsp; It is curious that, writing the later chapters
of &ldquo;Life and Habit&rdquo; in great haste, I should have
accidentally referred to the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; as
&ldquo;Natural Selection;&rdquo; it seems hard to believe that
there was no intention in my thus unconsciously reverting to Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s own original title, but there certainly was none,
and I did not then know what the original title had been.</p>
<p>If we had scrutinised Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s title-page as closely
as we should certainly scrutinise anything written by Mr. Darwin
now, we should have seen that the title did not technically claim
the theory of descent; practically, however, it so turned out
that we unhesitatingly gave that theory to the author, being, as
I have said, carried away by the three large &ldquo;Origins of
Species&rdquo; (which we understood as much the same thing as
descent with modification), and finding, as I shall show in a
later chapter, that descent was ubiquitously claimed throughout
the work, either expressly or by implication, as Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; It is not easy to see how any one
with ordinary instincts could hesitate to believe that Mr. Darwin
was entitled to claim what he claimed with so much
insistance.&nbsp; If <i>ars est celare artem</i> Mr. Darwin must
be allowed to have been a consummate artist, for it took us years
to understand the ins and outs of what had been done.</p>
<p>I may say in passing that we never see the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; spoken of as &ldquo;On the Origin of Species,
&amp;c.,&rdquo; or as &ldquo;The Origin of Species,
&amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; (the word &ldquo;on&rdquo; being dropped in
the latest editions).&nbsp; The distinctive feature of the book
lies, according to its admirers, in the &ldquo;&amp;c.,&rdquo;
but they never give it.&nbsp; To avoid pedantry I shall continue
to speak of the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At any rate it will be admitted that Mr. Darwin did not make
his title-page express his meaning so clearly that his readers
could readily catch the point of difference between himself and
his grandfather and Lamarck; nevertheless the point just touched
upon involves the only essential difference between the systems
of Mr. Charles Darwin and those of his three most important
predecessors.&nbsp; All four writers agree that animals and
plants descend with modification; all agree that the fittest
alone survive; all agree about the important consequences of the
geometrical ratio of increase; Mr. Charles Darwin has said more
about these last two points than his predecessors did, but all
three were alike cognisant of the facts and attached the same
importance to them, and would have been astonished at its being
supposed possible that they disputed them.&nbsp; The fittest
alone survive; yes&mdash;but the fittest from among what?&nbsp;
Here comes the point of divergence; the fittest from among
organisms whose variations arise mainly through use and
disuse?&nbsp; In other words, from variations that are mainly
functional?&nbsp; Or from among organisms whose variations are in
the main matters of luck?&nbsp; From variations into which a
moral and intellectual system of payment according to results has
largely entered?&nbsp; Or from variations which have been thrown
for with dice?&nbsp; From variations among which, though cards
tell, yet play tells as much or more?&nbsp; Or from those in
which cards are everything and play goes for so little as to be
not worth taking into account?&nbsp; Is &ldquo;the survival of
the fittest&rdquo; to be taken as meaning &ldquo;the survival of
the luckiest&rdquo; or &ldquo;the survival of those who know best
how to turn fortune to account&rdquo;?&nbsp; Is luck the only
element of fitness, or is not cunning even more
indispensable?</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin has a habit, borrowed, perhaps, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, from the framers of our collects, of every now and
then adding the words &ldquo;through natural selection,&rdquo; as
though this squared everything, and descent with modification
thus became his theory at once.&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp;
Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck believed in natural selection
to the full as much as any follower of Mr. Charles Darwin can
do.&nbsp; They did not use the actual words, but the idea
underlying them is the essence of their system.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick
Matthew epitomised their doctrine more tersely, perhaps, than was
done by any other of the pre-Charles-Darwinian evolutionists, in
the following passage which appeared in 1831, and which I have
already quoted in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; (pp. 320,
323).&nbsp; The passage runs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The self-regulating adaptive disposition of organised
life may, in part, be traced to the extreme fecundity of nature,
who, as before stated, has in all the varieties of her offspring
a prolific power much beyond (in many cases a thousandfold) what
is necessary to fill up the vacancies caused by senile
decay.&nbsp; As the field of existence is limited and
preoccupied, it is only the hardier, more robust, better suited
to circumstance individuals, who are able to struggle forward to
maturity, these inhabiting only the situations to which they have
superior adaptation and greater power of occupancy than any other
kind; the weaker and less circumstance-suited being prematurely
destroyed.&nbsp; This principle is in constant action; it
regulates the colour, the figure, the capacities, and instincts;
those individuals in each species whose colour and covering are
best suited to concealment or protection from enemies, or defence
from inclemencies or vicissitudes of climate, whose figure is
best accommodated to health, strength, defence, and support;
whose capacities and instincts can best regulate the physical
energies to self-advantage according to circumstances&mdash;in
such immense waste of primary and youthful life those only come
forward to maturity from <i>the strict ordeal by which nature
tests their adaptation to her standard of perfection</i> and
fitness to continue their kind by reproduction.&rdquo; <a
name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a>&nbsp; A little lower down Mr. Matthew
speaks of animals under domestication &ldquo;<i>not having
undergone selection by the law of nature</i>, <i>of which we have
spoken</i>, and hence being unable to maintain their ground
without culture and protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distinction between Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism is
generally believed to lie in the adoption of a theory of natural
selection by the younger Darwin and its non-adoption by the
elder.&nbsp; This is true in so far as that the elder Darwin does
not use the words &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; while the
younger does, but it is not true otherwise.&nbsp; Both writers
agree that offspring tends to inherit modifications that have
been effected, from whatever cause, in parents; both hold that
the best adapted to their surroundings live longest and leave
most offspring; both, therefore, hold that favourable
modifications will tend to be preserved and intensified in the
course of many generations, and that this leads to divergence of
type; but these opinions involve a theory of natural selection or
quasi-selection, whether the words &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; are used or not; indeed it is impossible to
include wild species in any theory of descent with modification
without implying a quasi-selective power on the part of nature;
but even with Mr. Charles Darwin the power is only
quasi-selective; there is no conscious choice, and hence there is
nothing that can in strictness be called selection.</p>
<p>It is indeed true that the younger Darwin gave the words
&ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; the importance which of late
years they have assumed; he probably adopted them unconsciously
from the passage of Mr. Matthew&rsquo;s quoted above, but he
ultimately said, <a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> &ldquo;In the literal sense of the
word (<i>sic</i>) no doubt natural selection is a false
term,&rdquo; as personifying a fact, making it exercise the
conscious choice without which there can be no selection, and
generally crediting it with the discharge of functions which can
only be ascribed legitimately to living and reasoning
beings.&nbsp; Granted, however, that while Mr. Charles Darwin
adopted the expression natural selection and admitted it to be a
bad one, his grandfather did not use it at all; still Mr. Darwin
did not mean the natural selection which Mr. Matthew and those
whose opinions he was epitomising meant.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin meant
the selection to be made from variations into which purpose
enters to only a small extent comparatively.&nbsp; The
difference, therefore, between the older evolutionists and their
successor does not lie in the acceptance by the more recent
writer of a quasi-selective power in nature which his
predecessors denied, but in the background&mdash;hidden behind
the words natural selection, which have served to cloak
it&mdash;in the views which the old and the new writers severally
took of the variations from among which they are alike agreed
that a selection or quasi-selection is made.</p>
<p>It now appears that there is not one natural selection, and
one survival of the fittest only, but two natural selections, and
two survivals of the fittest, the one of which may be objected to
as an expression more fit for religious and general literature
than for science, but may still be admitted as sound in
intention, while the other, inasmuch as it supposes accident to
be the main purveyor of variations, has no correspondence with
the actual course of things; for if the variations are matters of
chance or hazard unconnected with any principle of constant
application, they will not occur steadily enough, throughout a
sufficient number of successive generations, nor to a sufficient
number of individuals for many generations together at the same
time and place, to admit of the fixing and permanency of
modification at all.&nbsp; The one theory of natural selection,
therefore, may, and indeed will, explain the facts that surround
us, whereas the other will not.&nbsp; Mr. Charles Darwin&rsquo;s
contribution to the theory of evolution was not, as is commonly
supposed, &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; but the hypothesis
that natural selection from variations that are in the main
fortuitous could accumulate and result in specific and generic
differences.</p>
<p>In the foregoing paragraph I have given the point of
difference between Mr. Charles Darwin and his predecessors.&nbsp;
Why, I wonder, have neither he nor any of his exponents put this
difference before us in such plain words that we should readily
apprehend it?&nbsp; Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck were understood by
all who wished to understand them; why is it that the
misunderstanding of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;distinctive
feature&rdquo; should have been so long and obstinate?&nbsp; Why
is it that, no matter how much writers like Mr. Grant Allen and
Professor Ray Lankester may say about &ldquo;Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
master-key,&rdquo; nor how many more like hyperboles they
brandish, they never put a succinct <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>
of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory side by side with a similar
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of his grandfather&rsquo;s and
Lamarck&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Neither Mr. Darwin himself, not any of
those to whose advocacy his reputation is mainly due, have done
this.&nbsp; Professor Huxley is the man of all others who foisted
Mr. Darwin most upon us, but in his famous lecture on the coming
of age of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; he did not explain
to his hearers wherein the Neo-Darwinian theory of evolution
differed from the old; and why not?&nbsp; Surely, because no
sooner is this made clear than we perceive that the idea
underlying the old evolutionists is more in accord with
instinctive feelings that we have cherished too long to be able
now to disregard them than the central idea which underlies the
&ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What should we think of one who maintained that the
steam-engine and telescope were not developed mainly through
design and effort (letting the indisputably existing element of
luck go without saying), but to the fact that if any telescope or
steam-engine &ldquo;happened to be made ever such a little more
conveniently for man&rsquo;s purposes than another,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c.?</p>
<p>Let us suppose a notorious burglar found in possession of a
jemmy; it is admitted on all hands that he will use it as soon as
he gets a chance; there is no doubt about this; how perverted
should we not consider the ingenuity of one who tried to persuade
us we were wrong in thinking that the burglar compassed the
possession of the jemmy by means involving ideas, however vague
in the first instance, of applying it to its subsequent
function.</p>
<p>If any one could be found so blind to obvious inferences as to
accept natural selection, &ldquo;or the preservation of favoured
machines,&rdquo; as the main means of mechanical modification, we
might suppose him to argue much as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I can
quite understand,&rdquo; he would exclaim, &ldquo;how any one who
reflects upon the originally simple form of the earliest jemmies,
and observes the developments they have since attained in the
hands of our most accomplished housebreakers, might at first be
tempted to believe that the present form of the instrument has
been arrived at by long-continued improvement in the hands of an
almost infinite succession of thieves; but may not this inference
be somewhat too hastily drawn?&nbsp; Have we any right to assume
that burglars work by means analogous to those employed by other
people?&nbsp; If any thief happened to pick up any crowbar which
happened to be ever such a little better suited to his purpose
than the one he had been in the habit of using hitherto, he would
at once seize and carefully preserve it.&nbsp; If it got worn out
or broken he would begin searching for a crowbar as like as
possible to the one that he had lost; and when, with advancing
skill, and in default of being able to find the exact thing he
wanted, he took at length to making a jemmy for himself, he would
imitate the latest and most perfect adaptation, which would thus
be most likely to be preserved in the struggle of competitive
forms.&nbsp; Let this process go on for countless generations,
among countless burglars of all nations, and may we not suppose
that a jemmy would be in time arrived at, as superior to any that
could have been designed as the effect of the Niagara Falls is
superior to the puny efforts of the landscape
gardener?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment I will pass over the obvious retort that there
is no sufficient parallelism between bodily organs and mechanical
inventions to make a denial of design in the one involve in
equity a denial of it in the other also, and that therefore the
preceding paragraph has no force.&nbsp; A man is not bound to
deny design in machines wherein it can be clearly seen because he
denies it in living organs where at best it is a matter of
inference.&nbsp; This retort is plausible, but in the course of
the two next following chapters but one it will be shown to be
without force; for the moment, however, beyond thus calling
attention to it, I must pass it by.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that Mr. Darwin ever wrote anything which
made the utility of his contention as apparent as it is made by
what I have above put into the mouth of his supposed
follower.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin was the Gladstone of biology, and so
old a scientific hand was not going to make things unnecessarily
clear unless it suited his convenience.&nbsp; Then, indeed, he
was like the man in &ldquo;The Hunting of the Snark,&rdquo; who
said, &ldquo;I told you once, I told you twice, what I tell you
three times is true.&rdquo;&nbsp; That what I have supposed said,
however, above about the jemmy is no exaggeration of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s attitude as regards design in organism will appear
from the passage about the eye already referred to, which it may
perhaps be as well to quote in full.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a
telescope.&nbsp; We know that this instrument has been perfected
by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects,
and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat
analogous process.&nbsp; But may not this inference be
presumptuous?&nbsp; Have we any right to assume that the Creator
works by intellectual powers like those of men?&nbsp; If we must
compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination
to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve
sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this
layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to
separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses,
placed at different distances from each other, and with the
surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form.&nbsp; Further, we
must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each
slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers, and
carefully selecting each alteration which, under varied
circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce
a distincter image.&nbsp; We must suppose each new state of the
instrument to be multiplied by the million, and each to be
preserved till a better be produced, and then the old ones to be
destroyed.&nbsp; In living bodies variation will cause the slight
alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and
natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each
improvement.&nbsp; Let this process go on for millions on
millions of years, and during each year on millions of
individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living
optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of
glass as the works of the Creator are to those of man?&rdquo; <a
name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a"
class="citation">[92a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Darwin does not in this passage deny design, or cunning,
point blank; he was not given to denying things point blank, nor
is it immediately apparent that he is denying design at all, for
he does not emphasize and call attention to the fact that the
<i>variations</i> on whose accumulation he relies for his
ultimate specific difference are accidental, and, to use his own
words, in the passage last quoted, caused by
<i>variation</i>.&nbsp; He does, indeed, in his earlier editions,
call the variations &ldquo;accidental,&rdquo; and accidental they
remained for ten years, but in 1869 the word
&ldquo;accidental&rdquo; was taken out.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin probably
felt that the variations had been accidental as long as was
desirable; and though they would, of course, in reality remain as
accidental as ever, still, there could be no use in crying
&ldquo;accidental variations&rdquo; further.&nbsp; If the reader
wants to know whether they were accidental or no, he had better
find out for himself.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin was a master of what may
be called scientific chiaroscuro, and owes his reputation in no
small measure to the judgment with which he kept his meaning dark
when a less practised hand would have thrown light upon it.&nbsp;
There can, however, be no question that Mr. Darwin, though not
denying purposiveness point blank, was trying to refer the
development of the eye to the accumulation of small accidental
improvements, which were not as a rule due to effort and design
in any way analogous to those attendant on the development of the
telescope.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Darwin, if he was to have any point of difference
from his grandfather, was bound to make his variations
accidental, yet, to do him justice, he did not like it.&nbsp;
Even in the earlier editions of the &ldquo;Origin of
Species,&rdquo; where the &ldquo;alterations&rdquo; in the
passage last quoted are called &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; in
express terms, the word does not fall, so to speak, on a strong
beat of the bar, and is apt to pass unnoticed.&nbsp; Besides, Mr.
Darwin does not say point blank &ldquo;we may believe,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;we ought to believe;&rdquo; he only says &ldquo;may we not
believe?&rdquo;&nbsp; The reader should always be on his guard
when Mr. Darwin asks one of these bland and child-like questions,
and he is fond of asking them; but, however this may be, it is
plain, as I pointed out in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; <a
name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a> that the only &ldquo;skill,&rdquo;
that is to say the only thing that can possibly involve design,
is &ldquo;the unerring skill&rdquo; of natural selection.</p>
<p>In the same paragraph Mr. Darwin has already said:
&ldquo;Further, we must suppose that there is a power represented
by natural selection or the survival of the fittest always
intently watching each slight alteration, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin probably said &ldquo;a power represented by natural
selection&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; only,
because he saw that to talk too frequently about the fact that
the most lucky live longest as &ldquo;intently watching&rdquo;
something was greater nonsense than it would be prudent even for
him to write, so he fogged it by making the intent watching done
by &ldquo;a power represented by&rdquo; a fact, instead of by the
fact itself.&nbsp; As the sentence stands it is just as great
nonsense as it would have been if &ldquo;the survival of the
fittest&rdquo; had been allowed to do the watching instead of
&ldquo;the power represented by&rdquo; the survival of the
fittest, but the nonsense is harder to dig up, and the reader is
more likely to pass it over.</p>
<p>This passage gave Mr. Darwin no less trouble than it must have
given to many of his readers.&nbsp; In the original edition of
the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; it stood, &ldquo;Further, we
must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each
slight accidental variation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose it was felt
that if this was allowed to stand, it might be fairly asked what
natural selection was doing all this time?&nbsp; If the power was
able to do everything that was necessary now, why not always? and
why any natural selection at all?&nbsp; This clearly would not
do, so in 1861 the power was allowed, by the help of brackets,
actually to become natural selection, and remained so till 1869,
when Mr. Darwin could stand it no longer, and, doubtless for the
reason given above, altered the passage to &ldquo;a power
represented by natural selection,&rdquo; at the same time cutting
out the word &ldquo;accidental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may perhaps make the workings of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind
clearer to the reader if I give the various readings of this
passage as taken from the three most important editions of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1859 it stood, &ldquo;Further, we must suppose that there
is a power always intently watching each slight accidental
alteration,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>In 1861 it stood, &ldquo;Further, we must suppose that there
is a power (natural selection) always intently watching each
slight accidental alteration,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>And in 1869, &ldquo;Further, we must suppose that there is a
power represented by natural selection or the survival of the
fittest always intently watching each slight alteration,&rdquo;
&amp;c. <a name="citation94a"></a><a href="#footnote94a"
class="citation">[94a]</a></p>
<p>The hesitating feeble gait of one who fears a pitfall at every
step, so easily recognisable in the &ldquo;numerous, successive,
slight alterations&rdquo; in the foregoing passage, may be traced
in many another page of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; by
those who will be at the trouble of comparing the several
editions.&nbsp; It is only when this is done, and the working of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind can be seen as though it were the
twitchings of a dog&rsquo;s nose, that any idea can be formed of
the difficulty in which he found himself involved by his initial
blunder of thinking he had got a distinctive feature which
entitled him to claim the theory of evolution as an original idea
of his own.&nbsp; He found his natural selection hang round his
neck like a millstone.&nbsp; There is hardly a page in the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; in which traces of the struggle
going on in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind are not discernible, with a
result alike exasperating and pitiable.&nbsp; I can only repeat
what I said in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo; namely, that
I find the task of extracting a well-defined meaning out of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s words comparable only to that of trying to act on
the advice of a lawyer who has obscured the main issue as much as
he can, and whose chief aim has been to leave as many loopholes
as possible for himself to escape by, if things should go wrong
hereafter.&nbsp; Or, again, to that of one who has to construe an
Act of Parliament which was originally drawn with a view to
throwing as much dust as possible in the eyes of those who would
oppose the measure, and which, having been found utterly
unworkable in practice, has had clauses repealed up and down it
till it is now in an inextricable tangle of confusion and
contradiction.</p>
<p>The more Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work is studied, and more
especially the more his different editions are compared, the more
impossible is it to avoid a suspicion of <i>arri&egrave;re
pens&eacute;e</i> as pervading it whenever the &ldquo;distinctive
feature&rdquo; is on the <i>tapis</i>.&nbsp; It is right to say,
however, that no such suspicion attaches to Mr. A. R. Wallace,
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s fellow discoverer of natural selection.&nbsp;
It is impossible to doubt that Mr. Wallace believed he had made a
real and important improvement upon the Lamarckian system, and,
as a natural consequence, unlike Mr. Darwin, he began by telling
us what Lamarck had said.&nbsp; He did not, I admit, say quite
all that I should have been glad to have seen him say, nor use
exactly the words I should myself have chosen, but he said enough
to make it impossible to doubt his good faith, and his desire
that we should understand that with him, as with Mr. Darwin,
variations are mainly accidental, not functional.&nbsp; Thus, in
his memorable paper communicated to the Linnean Society in 1858
he said, in a passage which I have quoted in &ldquo;Unconscious
Memory&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hypothesis of Lamarck&mdash;that progressive
changes in species have been produced by the attempts of the
animals to increase the development of their own organs, and thus
modify their structures and habits&mdash;has been repeatedly and
easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties and
species; . . . but the view here developed renders such an
hypothesis quite unnecessary. . . .&nbsp; The powerful retractile
talons of the falcon and cat tribes have not been produced or
increased by the volition of those animals; . . . neither did the
giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of
the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for
this purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its
antitypes with a longer neck than usual <i>at once secured a
fresh range of pasture over the same ground as their
shorter-necked companions</i>, <i>and on the first scarcity of
food were thus enabled to outlive them</i>&rdquo; (italics in
original). <a name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Which occurred&rdquo; is obviously &ldquo;which
happened to occur, by some chance or accident entirely
unconnected with use and disuse;&rdquo; and though the word
&ldquo;accidental&rdquo; is never used, there can be no doubt
about Mr. Wallace&rsquo;s desire to make the reader catch the
fact that with him accident, and not, as with Erasmus Darwin and
Lamarck, sustained effort, is the main purveyor of the variations
whose accumulation amounts ultimately to specific
difference.&nbsp; It is a pity, however, that instead of
contenting himself like a theologian with saying that his
opponent had been refuted over and over again, he did not refer
to any particular and tolerably successful attempt to refute the
theory that modifications in organic structure are mainly
functional.&nbsp; I am fairly well acquainted with the literature
of evolution, and have never met with any such attempt.&nbsp; But
let this pass; as with Mr. Darwin, so with Mr. Wallace, and so
indeed with all who accept Mr. Charles Darwin&rsquo;s natural
selection as the main means of modification, the central idea is
luck, while the central idea of the Erasmus-Darwinian system is
cunning.</p>
<p>I have given the opinions of these contending parties in their
extreme development; but they both admit abatements which bring
them somewhat nearer to one another.&nbsp; Design, as even its
most strenuous upholders will admit, is a difficult word to deal
with; it is, like all our ideas, substantial enough until we try
to grasp it&mdash;and then, like all our ideas, it mockingly
eludes us; it is like life or death&mdash;a rope of many strands;
there is design within design, and design within undesign; there
is undesign within design (as when a man shuffles cards designing
that there shall be no design in their arrangement), and undesign
within undesign; when we speak of cunning or design in connection
with organism we do not mean cunning, all cunning, and nothing
but cunning, so that there shall be no place for luck; we do not
mean that conscious attention and forethought shall have been
bestowed upon the minutest details of action, and nothing been
left to work itself out departmentally according to precedent, or
as it otherwise best may according to the chapter of
accidents.</p>
<p>So, again, when Mr. Darwin and his followers deny design and
effort to have been the main purveyors of the variations whose
accumulation results in specific difference, they do not entirely
exclude the action of use and disuse&mdash;and this at once opens
the door for cunning; nevertheless, according to Erasmus Darwin
and Lamarck, the human eye and the long neck of the giraffe are
alike due to the accumulation of variations that are mainly
functional, and hence practical; according to Charles Darwin they
are alike due to the accumulation of variations that are
accidental, fortuitous, spontaneous, that is to say, mainly
cannot be reduced to any known general principle.&nbsp; According
to Charles Darwin &ldquo;the preservation of favoured,&rdquo; or
lucky, &ldquo;races&rdquo; is by far the most important means of
modification; according to Erasmus Darwin effort <i>non sibi res
sed se rebus subjungere</i> is unquestionably the most potent
means; roughly, therefore, there is no better or fairer way of
putting the matter, than to say that Charles Darwin is the
apostle of luck, and his grandfather, and Lamarck, of
cunning.</p>
<p>It should be observed also that the distinction between the
organism and its surroundings&mdash;on which both systems are
founded&mdash;is one that cannot be so universally drawn as we
find it convenient to allege.&nbsp; There is a debatable ground
of considerable extent on which <i>res</i> and <i>me</i>, ego and
non ego, luck and cunning, necessity and freewill, meet and pass
into one another as night and day, or life and death.&nbsp; No
one can draw a sharp line between ego and non ego, nor indeed any
sharp line between any classes of phenomena.&nbsp; Every part of
the ego is non ego <i>qu&acirc;</i> organ or tool in use, and
much of the non ego runs up into the ego and is inseparably
united with it; still there is enough that it is obviously most
convenient to call ego, and enough that it is no less obviously
most convenient to call non ego, as there is enough obvious day
and obvious night, or obvious luck and obvious cunning, to make
us think it advisable to keep separate accounts for each.</p>
<p>I will say more on this head in a following chapter; in this
present one my business should be confined to pointing out as
clearly and succinctly as I can the issue between the two great
main contending opinions concerning organic development that
obtain among those who accept the theory of descent at all; nor
do I believe that this can be done more effectually and
accurately than by saying, as above, that Mr. Charles Darwin
(whose name, by the way, was &ldquo;Charles Robert,&rdquo; and
not, as would appear from the title-pages of his books,
&ldquo;Charles&rdquo; only), Mr. A. R. Wallace, and their
supporters are the apostles of luck, while Erasmus Darwin and
Lamarck, followed, more or less timidly, by the Geoffroys and by
Mr. Herbert Spencer, and very timidly indeed by the Duke of
Argyll, preach cunning as the most important means of organic
modification.</p>

(<i>Intercalated</i>)<br />
Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Factors of Organic
Evolution&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the foregoing and several of
the succeeding chapters were written, Mr. Herbert Spencer has
made his position at once more clear and more widely understood
by his articles &ldquo;The Factors of Organic Evolution&rdquo;
which appeared in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> for April and
May, 1886.&nbsp; The present appears the fittest place in which
to intercalate remarks concerning them.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer asks whether those are right who regard Mr.
Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection as by itself
sufficient to account for organic evolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On critically examining the evidence&rdquo; (modern
writers never examine evidence, they always
&ldquo;critically,&rdquo; or &ldquo;carefully,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;patiently,&rdquo; examine it), he writes, &ldquo;we shall
find reason to think that it by no means explains all that has to
be explained.&nbsp; Omitting for the present any consideration of
a factor which may be considered primordial, it may be contended
that one of the factors alleged by Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck
must be recognised as a co-operator.&nbsp; Unless that increase
of a part resulting from extra activity, and that decrease of it
resulting from inactivity, are transmissible to descendants, we
are without a key to many phenomena of organic evolution.&nbsp;
<i>Utterly inadequate to explain the major part of the facts as
is the hypothesis of the inheritance of functionally produced
modifications</i>, yet there is a minor part of the facts very
extensive though less, which must be ascribed to this
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Italics mine.)</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer does not here say expressly that Erasmus Darwin
and Lamarck considered inheritance of functionally produced
modifications to be the sole explanation of the facts of organic
life; modern writers on evolution for the most part avoid saying
anything expressly; this nevertheless is the conclusion which the
reader naturally draws&mdash;and was doubtless intended to
draw&mdash;from Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; He gathers that
these writers put forward an &ldquo;utterly inadequate&rdquo;
theory, which cannot for a moment be entertained in the form in
which they left it, but which, nevertheless, contains
contributions to the formation of a just opinion which of late
years have been too much neglected.</p>
<p>This inference would be, as Mr. Spencer ought to know, a
mistaken one.&nbsp; Erasmus Darwin, who was the first to depend
mainly on functionally produced modifications, attributes, if not
as much importance to variations induced either by what we must
call chance, or by causes having no connection with use and
disuse, as Mr. Spencer does, still so nearly as much that there
is little to choose between them.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s words
show that he attributes, if not half, still not far off half the
modification that has actually been produced, to use and
disuse.&nbsp; Erasmus Darwin does not say whether he considers
use and disuse to have brought about more than half or less than
half; he only says that animal and vegetable modification is
&ldquo;in part produced&rdquo; by the exertions of the animals
and vegetables themselves; the impression I have derived is, that
just as Mr. Spencer considers rather less than half to be due to
use and disuse, so Erasmus Darwin considers decidedly more than
half&mdash;so much more, in fact, than half as to make function
unquestionably the factor most proper to be insisted on if only
one can be given.&nbsp; Further than this he did not go.&nbsp; I
will quote enough of Dr. Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s own words to put
his position beyond doubt.&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced
in the species of animals before their nativity, as, for example,
when the offspring reproduces the effects produced upon the
parent by accident or culture, or the changes produced by the
mixture of species, as in mules; or the changes produced probably
by exuberance of nourishment supplied to the foetus, as in
monstrous births with additional limbs; many of these enormities
are propagated and continued as a variety at least, if not as a
new species of animal.&nbsp; I have seen a breed of cats with an
additional claw on every foot; of poultry also with an additional
claw and with wings to their feet; and of others without
rumps.&nbsp; Mr. Buffon&rdquo; (who, by the way, surely, was no
more &ldquo;Mr. Buffon&rdquo; than Lord Salisbury is &ldquo;Mr.
Salisbury&rdquo;) &ldquo;mentions a breed of dogs without tails
which are common at Rome and Naples&mdash;which he supposes to
have been produced by a custom long established of cutting their
tails close off.&rdquo; <a name="citation102a"></a><a
href="#footnote102a" class="citation">[102a]</a></p>
<p>Here not one of the causes of variation adduced is connected
with use and disuse, or effort, volition, and purpose; the
manner, moreover, in which they are brought forward is not that
of one who shows signs of recalcitrancy about admitting other
causes of modification as well as use and disuse; indeed, a
little lower down he almost appears to assign the subordinate
place to functionally produced modifications, for he
says&mdash;&ldquo;Fifthly, from their first rudiments or
primordium to the termination of their lives, all animals undergo
perpetual transformations; <i>which are in part produced</i> by
their own exertions in consequence of their desires and
aversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritations
or of associations; and many of these acquired forms or
propensities are transmitted to their posterity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have quoted enough to show that Dr. Erasmus Darwin would
have protested against the supposition that functionally produced
modifications were an adequate explanation of all the phenomena
of organic modification.&nbsp; He declares accident and the
chances and changes of this mortal life to be potent and frequent
causes of variations, which, being not infrequently inherited,
result in the formation of varieties and even species, but
considers these causes if taken alone as no less insufficient to
account for observable facts than the theory of functionally
produced modifications would be if not supplemented by
inheritance of so-called fortuitous, or spontaneous
variations.&nbsp; The difference between Dr. Erasmus Darwin and
Mr. Spencer does not consist in the denial by the first, that a
variety which happens, no matter how accidentally, to have varied
in a way that enables it to comply more fully and readily with
the conditions of its existence, is likely to live longer and
leave more offspring than one less favoured; nor in the denial by
the second of the inheritance and accumulation of functionally
produced modifications; but in the amount of stress which they
respectively lay on the relative importance of the two great
factors of organic evolution, the existence of which they are
alike ready to admit.</p>
<p>With Erasmus Darwin there is indeed luck, and luck has had a
great deal to do with organic modification, but no amount of luck
would have done unless cunning had known how to take advantage of
it; whereas if cunning be given, a very little luck at a time
will accumulate in the course of ages and become a mighty
heap.&nbsp; Cunning, therefore, is the factor on which, having
regard to the usage of language and the necessity for simplifying
facts, he thinks it most proper to insist.&nbsp; Surely this is
as near as may be the opinion which common consent ascribes to
Mr. Spencer himself.&nbsp; It is certainly the one which, in
supporting Erasmus Darwin&rsquo;s system as against his
grandson&rsquo;s, I have always intended to support.&nbsp; With
Charles Darwin, on the other hand, there is indeed cunning,
effort, and consequent use and disuse; nor does he deny that
these have produced some, and sometimes even an important, effect
in modifying species, but he assigns by far the most important
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> in the whole scheme to natural selection,
which, as I have already shown, must, with him, be regarded as a
synonym for luck pure and simple.&nbsp; This, for reasons well
shown by Mr. Spencer in the articles under consideration, is so
untenable that it seems only possible to account for its having
been advanced at all by supposing Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s judgment to
have been perverted by some one or more of the many causes that
might tend to warp them.&nbsp; What the chief of those causes may
have been I shall presently point out.</p>
<p>Buffon erred rather on the side of ignoring functionally
produced modifications than of insisting on them.&nbsp; The main
agency with him is the direct action of the environment upon the
organism.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is a flaw in Buffon&rsquo;s
immortal work, but it is one which Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck
easily corrected; nor can we doubt that Buffon would have readily
accepted their amendment if it had been suggested to him.&nbsp;
Buffon did infinitely more in the way of discovering and
establishing the theory of descent with modification than any one
has ever done either before or since.&nbsp; He was too much
occupied with proving the fact of evolution at all, to dwell as
fully as might have been wished upon the details of the process
whereby the am&oelig;ba had become man, but we have already seen
that he regarded inherited mutilation as the cause of
establishing a new breed of dogs, and this is at any rate not
laying much stress on functionally produced modifications.&nbsp;
Again, when writing of the dog, he speaks of variations arising
&ldquo;<i>by some chance</i> common enough with nature,&rdquo; <a
name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a> and clearly does not contemplate
function as the sole cause of modification.&nbsp; Practically,
though I grant I should be less able to quote passages in support
of my opinion than I quite like, I do not doubt that his position
was much the same as that of his successors, Erasmus Darwin and
Lamarck.</p>
<p>Lamarck is more vulnerable than either Erasmus Darwin or
Buffon on the score of unwillingness to assign its full share to
mere chance, but I do not for a moment believe his comparative
reticence to have been caused by failure to see that the chapter
of accidents is a fateful one.&nbsp; He saw that the cunning or
functional side had been too much lost sight of, and therefore
insisted on it, but he did not mean to say that there is no such
thing as luck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us suppose,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;that a grass growing in a low-lying meadow, gets carried
<i>by some accident</i> to the brow of a neighbouring hill, where
the soil is still damp enough for the plant to be able to
exist.&rdquo; <a name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; Or again&mdash;&ldquo;With
sufficient time, favourable conditions of life, successive
changes in the condition of the globe, and the power of new
surroundings and habits to modify the organs of living bodies,
all animal and vegetable forms have been imperceptibly rendered
such as we now see them.&rdquo; <a name="citation105b"></a><a
href="#footnote105b" class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; Who can
doubt that accident is here regarded as a potent factor of
evolution, as well as the design that is involved in the
supposition that modification is, in the main, functionally
induced?&nbsp; Again he writes, &ldquo;As regards the
circumstances that give rise to variation, the principal are
climatic changes, different temperatures of any of a
creature&rsquo;s environments, differences of abode, of habit, of
the most frequent actions, and lastly of the means of obtaining
food, self-defence, reproduction,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a
name="citation105c"></a><a href="#footnote105c"
class="citation">[105c]</a>&nbsp; I will not dwell on the small
inconsistencies which may be found in the passages quoted above;
the reader will doubtless see them, and will also doubtless see
that in spite of them there can be no doubt that Lamarck, while
believing modification to be effected mainly by the survival in
the struggle for existence of modifications which had been
induced functionally, would not have hesitated to admit the
survival of favourable variations due to mere accident as also a
potent factor in inducing the results we see around us.</p>
<p>For the rest, Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s articles have relieved me
from the necessity of going into the evidence which proves that
such structures as a giraffe&rsquo;s neck, for example, cannot
possibly have been produced by the accumulation of variations
which had their origin mainly in accident.&nbsp; There is no
occasion to add anything to what Mr. Spencer has said on this
score, and I am satisfied that those who do not find his argument
convince them would not be convinced by anything I might say; I
shall, therefore, omit what I had written on this subject, and
confine myself to giving the substance of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s
most telling argument against Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory that
accidental variations, if favourable, would accumulate and result
in seemingly adaptive structures.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer well shows
that luck or chance is insufficient as a motive-power, or helm,
of evolution; but luck is only absence of design; if, then,
absence of design is found to fail, it follows that there must
have been design somewhere, nor can the design be more
conveniently placed than in association with function.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer contends that where life is so simple as to
consist practically in the discharge of only one function, or
where circumstances are such that some one function is supremely
important (a state of things, by the way, more easily found in
hypothesis than in nature&mdash;at least as continuing without
modification for many successive seasons), then accidental
variations, if favourable, would indeed accumulate and result in
modification, without the aid of the transmission of functionally
produced modification.&nbsp; This is true; it is also true,
however, that only a very small number of species in comparison
with those we see around us could thus arise, and that we should
never have got plants and animals as embodiments of the two great
fundamental principles on which it is alone possible that life
can be conducted, <a name="citation107a"></a><a
href="#footnote107a" class="citation">[107a]</a> and species of
plants and animals as embodiments of the details involved in
carrying out these two main principles.</p>
<p>If the earliest organism could have only varied favourably in
one direction, the one possible favourable accidental variation
would have accumulated so long as the organism continued to exist
at all, inasmuch as this would be preserved whenever it happened
to occur, while every other would be lost in the struggle of
competitive forms; but even in the lowest forms of life there is
more than one condition in respect of which the organism must be
supposed sensitive, and there are as many directions in which
variations may be favourable as there are conditions of the
environment that affect the organism.&nbsp; We cannot conceive of
a living form as having a power of adaptation limited to one
direction only; the elasticity which admits of a not being
&ldquo;extreme to mark that which is done amiss&rdquo; in one
direction will commonly admit of it in as many directions as
there are possible favourable modes of variation; the number of
these, as has been just said, depends upon the number of the
conditions of the environment that affect the organism, and these
last, though in the long run and over considerable intervals of
time tolerably constant, are over shorter intervals liable to
frequent and great changes; so that there is nothing in Mr.
Charles Darwin&rsquo;s system of modification through the natural
survival of the lucky, to prevent gain in one direction one year
from being lost irretrievably in the next, through the greater
success of some in no way correlated variation, the fortunate
possessors of which alone survive.&nbsp; This, in its turn, is as
likely as not to disappear shortly through the arising of some
difficulty in some entirely new direction, and so on; nor, if
function be regarded as of small effect in determining organism,
is there anything to ensure either that, even if ground be lost
for a season or two in any one direction, it shall be recovered
presently on resumption by the organism of the habits that called
it into existence, or that it shall appear synchronously in a
sufficient number of individuals to ensure its not being soon
lost through gamogenesis.</p>
<p>How is progress ever to be made if races keep reversing,
Penelope-like, in one generation all that they have been
achieving in the preceding?&nbsp; And how, on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
system, of which the accumulation of strokes of luck is the
greatly preponderating feature, is a hoard ever to be got
together and conserved, no matter how often luck may have thrown
good things in an organism&rsquo;s way?&nbsp; Luck, or absence of
design, may be sometimes almost said to throw good things in our
way, or at any rate we may occasionally get more through having
made no design than any design we should have been likely to have
formed would have given us; but luck does not hoard these good
things for our use and make our wills for us, nor does it keep
providing us with the same good gifts again and again, and no
matter how often we reject them.</p>
<p>I had better, perhaps, give Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s own words as
quoted by himself in his article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>
for April, 1886.&nbsp; He there wrote as follows, quoting from
&sect; 166 of his &ldquo;Principles of Biology,&rdquo; which
appeared in 1864:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the life is comparatively simple, or where
surrounding circumstances render some one function supremely
important, the survival of the fittest&rdquo; (which means here
the survival of the luckiest) &ldquo;may readily bring about the
appropriate structural change, without any aid from the
transmission of functionally-acquired modifications&rdquo; (into
which effort and design have entered).&nbsp; &ldquo;But in
proportion as the life grows complex&mdash;in proportion as a
healthy existence cannot be secured by a large endowment of some
one power, but demands many powers; in the same proportion do
there arise obstacles to the increase of any particular power, by
&lsquo;the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for
life&rsquo;&rdquo; (that is to say, through mere survival of the
luckiest).&nbsp; &ldquo;As fast as the faculties are multiplied,
so fast does it become possible for the several members of a
species to have various kinds of superiority over one
another.&nbsp; While one saves its life by higher speed, another
does the like by clearer vision, another by keener scent, another
by quicker hearing, another by greater strength, another by
unusual power of enduring cold or hunger, another by special
sagacity, another by special timidity, another by special
courage; and others by other bodily and mental attributes.&nbsp;
Now it is unquestionably true that, other things equal, each of
these attributes, giving its possessor an equal extra chance of
life, is likely to be transmitted to posterity.&nbsp; But there
seems no reason to believe it will be increased in subsequent
generations by natural selection.&nbsp; That it may be thus
increased, the animals not possessing more than average
endowments of it must be more frequently killed off than
individuals highly endowed with it; and this can only happen when
the attribute is one of greater importance, for the time being,
than most of the other attributes.&nbsp; If those members of the
species which have but ordinary shares of it, nevertheless
survive by virtue of other superiorities which they severally
possess, then it is not easy to see how this particular attribute
can be developed by natural selection in subsequent
generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; (For if some other superiority is a
greater source of luck, then natural selection, or survival of
the luckiest, will ensure that this other superiority be
preserved at the expense of the one acquired in the earlier
generation.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The probability seems rather to be,
that by gamogenesis, this extra endowment will, on the average,
be diminished in posterity&mdash;just serving in the long run to
compensate the deficient endowments of other individuals, whose
special powers lie in other directions; and so to keep up the
normal structure of the species.&nbsp; The working out of the
process is here somewhat difficult to follow&rdquo; (there is no
difficulty as soon as it is perceived that Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
natural selection invariably means, or ought to mean, the
survival of the luckiest, and that seasons and what they bring
with them, though fairly constant on an average, yet individually
vary so greatly that what is luck in one season is disaster in
another); &ldquo;but it appears to me that as fast as the number
of bodily and mental faculties increases, and as fast as the
maintenance of life comes to depend less on the amount of any
one, and more on the combined action of all, so fast does the
production of specialities of character by natural selection
alone become difficult.&nbsp; Particularly does this seem to be
so with a species so multitudinous in powers as mankind; and
above all does it seem to be so with such of the human powers as
have but minor shares in aiding the struggle for life&mdash;the
&aelig;sthetic faculties, for example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dwelling for a moment on this last illustration of the
class of difficulties described, let us ask how we are to
interpret the development of the musical faculty; how came there
that endowment of musical faculty which characterises modern
Europeans at large, as compared with their remote
ancestors?&nbsp; The monotonous chants of low savages cannot be
said to show any melodic inspiration; and it is not evident that
an individual savage who had a little more musical perception
than the rest would derive any such advantage in the maintenance
of life as would secure the spread of his superiority by
inheritance of the variation,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>It should be observed that the passage given in the last
paragraph but one appeared in 1864, only five years after the
first edition of the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; but,
crushing as it is, Mr. Darwin never answered it.&nbsp; He treated
it as nonexistent&mdash;and this, doubtless from a business
standpoint, was the best thing he could do.&nbsp; How far such a
course was consistent with that single-hearted devotion to the
interests of science for which Mr. Darwin developed such an
abnormal reputation, is a point which I must leave to his many
admirers to determine.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Property, Common Sense, and Protoplasm</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> would think the issue stated in
the three preceding chapters was decided in the stating.&nbsp;
This, as I have already implied, is probably the reason why those
who have a vested interest in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s philosophical
reputation have avoided stating it.</p>
<p>It may be said that, seeing the result is a joint one,
inasmuch as both &ldquo;res&rdquo; and &ldquo;me,&rdquo; or both
luck and cunning, enter so largely into development, neither
factor can claim pre-eminence to the exclusion of the
other.&nbsp; But life is short and business long, and if we are
to get the one into the other we must suppress details, and leave
our words pregnant, as painters leave their touches when painting
from nature.&nbsp; If one factor concerns us greatly more than
the other, we should emphasize it, and let the other go without
saying, by force of association.&nbsp; There is no fear of its
being lost sight of; association is one of the few really liberal
things in nature; by liberal, I mean precipitate and inaccurate;
the power of words, as of pictures, and indeed the power to carry
on life at all, vests in the fact that association does not stick
to the letter of its bond, but will take the half for the whole
without even looking closely at the coin given to make sure that
it is not counterfeit.&nbsp; Through the haste and high pressure
of business, errors arise continually, and these errors give us
the shocks of which our consciousness is compounded.&nbsp; Our
whole conscious life, therefore, grows out of memory and out of
the power of association, in virtue of which not only does the
right half pass for the whole, but the wrong half not
infrequently passes current for it also, without being challenged
and found out till, as it were, the accounts come to be balanced,
and it is found that they will not do so.</p>
<p>Variations are an organism&rsquo;s way of getting over an
unexpected discrepancy between its resources as shown by the
fly-leaves of its own cheques and the universe&rsquo;s passbook;
the universe is generally right, or would be upheld as right if
the matter were to come before the not too incorruptible courts
of nature, and in nine cases out of ten the organism has made the
error in its own favour, so that it must now pay or die.&nbsp; It
can only pay by altering its mode of life, and how long is it
likely to be before a new departure in its mode of life comes out
in its own person and in those of its family?&nbsp; Granted it
will at first come out in their appearance only, but there can be
no change in appearance without some slight corresponding organic
modification.&nbsp; In practice there is usually compromise in
these matters.&nbsp; The universe, if it does not give an
organism short shrift and eat it at once, will commonly abate
something of its claim; it gets tricked out of an additional
moiety by the organism; the organism really does pay something by
way of changed habits; this results in variation, in virtue of
which the accounts are cooked, cobbled, and passed by a series of
those miracles of inconsistency which was call compromises, and
after this they cannot be reopened&mdash;not till next time.</p>
<p>Surely of the two factors which go to the making up of
development, cunning is the one more proper to be insisted on as
determining the physical and psychical well or ill being, and
hence, ere long, the future form of the organism.&nbsp; We can
hardly open a newspaper without seeing some sign of this; take,
for example, the following extract from a letter in the
<i>Times</i> of the day on which I am writing (February 8,
1886)&mdash;&ldquo;You may pass along a road which divides a
settlement of Irish Celts from one of Germans.&nbsp; They all
came to the country equally without money, and have had to fight
their way in the forest, but the difference in their condition is
very remarkable; on the German side there is comfort, thrift,
peace, but on the other side the spectacle is very
different.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few will deny that slight organic
differences, corresponding to these differences of habit, are
already perceptible; no Darwinian will deny that these
differences are likely to be inherited, and, in the absence of
intermarriage between the two colonies, to result in still more
typical difference than that which exists at present.&nbsp;
According to Mr. Darwin, the improved type of the more successful
race would not be due mainly to transmitted perseverance in
well-doing, but to the fact that if any member of the German
colony &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to be born &ldquo;ever so
slightly,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Of course this last is true to a
certain extent also; if any member of the German colony does
&ldquo;happen to be born,&rdquo; &amp;c., then he will stand a
better chance of surviving, and, if he marries a wife like
himself, of transmitting his good qualities; but how about the
happening?&nbsp; How is it that this is of such frequent
occurrence in the one colony, and is so rare in the other?&nbsp;
<i>Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis</i>.&nbsp; True, but how and
why?&nbsp; Through the race being favoured?&nbsp; In one sense,
doubtless, it is true that no man can have anything except it be
given him from above, but it must be from an above into the
composition of which he himself largely enters.&nbsp; God gives
us all things; but we are a part of God, and that part of Him,
moreover, whose department it more especially is to look after
ourselves.&nbsp; It cannot be through luck, for luck is blind,
and does not pick out the same people year after year and
generation after generation; shall we not rather say, then, that
it is because mind, or cunning, is a great factor in the
achievement of physical results, and because there is an abiding
memory between successive generations, in virtue of which the
cunning of an earlier one enures to the benefit of its
successors?</p>
<p>It is one of the commonplaces of biology that the nature of
the organism (which is mainly determined by ancestral
antecedents) is greatly more important in determining its future
than the conditions of its environment, provided, of course, that
these are not too cruelly abnormal, so that good seed will do
better on rather poor soil, than bad seed on rather good soil;
this alone should be enough to show that cunning, or individual
effort, is more important in determining organic results than
luck is, and therefore that if either is to be insisted on to the
exclusion of the other, it should be cunning, not luck.&nbsp;
Which is more correctly said to be the main means of the
development of capital&mdash;Luck? or Cunning?&nbsp; Of course
there must be something to be developed&mdash;and luck, that is
to say, the unknowable and unforeseeable, enters everywhere; but
is it more convenient with our oldest and best-established ideas
to say that luck is the main means of the development of capital,
or that cunning is so?&nbsp; Can there be a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation in admitting that if capital is found to have been
developed largely, continuously, by many people, in many ways,
over a long period of time, it can only have been by means of
continued application, energy, effort, industry, and good
sense?&nbsp; Granted there has been luck too; of course there
has, but we let it go without saying, whereas we cannot let the
skill or cunning go without saying, inasmuch as we feel the
cunning to have been the essence of the whole matter.</p>
<p>Granted, again, that there is no test more fallacious on a
small scale than that of immediate success.&nbsp; As applied to
any particular individual, it breaks down completely.&nbsp; It is
unfortunately no rare thing to see the good man striving against
fate, and the fool born with a silver spoon in his mouth.&nbsp;
Still on a large scale no test can be conceivably more reliable;
a blockhead may succeed for a time, but a succession of many
generations of blockheads does not go on steadily gaining ground,
adding field to field and farm to farm, and becoming year by year
more capable and prosperous.&nbsp; Given time&mdash;of which
there is no scant in the matter of organic development&mdash;and
cunning will do more with ill luck than folly with good.&nbsp;
People do not hold six trumps every hand for a dozen games of
whist running, if they do not keep a card or two up their
sleeves.&nbsp; Cunning, if it can keep its head above water at
all, will beat mere luck unaided by cunning, no matter what start
luck may have had, if the race be a fairly long one.&nbsp; Growth
is a kind of success which does indeed come to some organisms
with less effort than to others, but it cannot be maintained and
improved upon without pains and effort.&nbsp; A foolish organism
and its fortuitous variation will be soon parted, for, as a
general rule, unless the variation has so much connection with
the organism&rsquo;s past habits and ways of thought as to be in
no proper sense of the word &ldquo;fortuitous,&rdquo; the
organism will not know what to do with it when it has got it, no
matter how favourable it may be, and it is little likely to be
handed down to descendants.&nbsp; Indeed the kind of people who
get on best in the world&mdash;and what test to a Darwinian can
be comparable to this?&mdash;commonly do insist on cunning rather
than on luck, sometimes perhaps even unduly; speaking, at least,
from experience, I have generally found myself more or less of a
failure with those Darwinians to whom I have endeavoured to
excuse my shortcomings on the score of luck.</p>
<p>It may be said that the contention that the nature of the
organism does more towards determining its future than the
conditions of its immediate environment do, is only another way
of saying that the accidents which have happened to an organism
in the persons of its ancestors throughout all time are more
irresistible by it for good or ill than any of the more ordinary
chances and changes of its own immediate life.&nbsp; I do not
deny this; but these ancestral accidents were either turned to
account, or neglected where they might have been taken advantage
of; they thus passed either into skill, or want of skill; so that
whichever way the fact is stated the result is the same; and if
simplicity of statement be regarded, there is no more convenient
way of putting the matter than to say that though luck is mighty,
cunning is mightier still.&nbsp; Organism commonly shows its
cunning by practising what Horace preached, and treating itself
as more plastic than its surroundings; those indeed who have had
the greatest the first to admit that they had gained their ends
more by reputation as moulders of circumstances have ever been
shaping their actions and themselves to suit events, than by
trying to shape events to suit themselves and their
actions.&nbsp; Modification, like charity, begins at home.</p>
<p>But however this may be, there can be no doubt that cunning is
in the long run mightier than luck as regards the acquisition of
property, and what applies to property applies to organism
also.&nbsp; Property, as I have lately seen was said by Rosmini,
is a kind of extension of the personality into the outside
world.&nbsp; He might have said as truly that it is a kind of
penetration of the outside world within the limits of the
personality, or that it is at any rate a prophesying of, and
essay after, the more living phase of matter in the direction of
which it is tending.&nbsp; If approached from the dynamical or
living side of the underlying substratum, it is the beginning of
the comparatively stable equilibrium which we call brute matter;
if from the statical side, that is to say, from that of brute
matter, it is the beginning of that dynamical state which we
associate with life; it is the last of ego and first of non ego,
or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, as the case may be; it is the ground
whereon the two meet and are neither wholly one nor wholly the
other, but a whirling mass of contradictions such as attends all
fusion.</p>
<p>What property is to a man&rsquo;s mind or soul that his body
is also, only more so.&nbsp; The body is property carried to the
bitter end, or property is the body carried to the bitter end,
whichever the reader chooses; the expression &ldquo;organic
wealth&rdquo; is not figurative; none other is so apt and
accurate; so universally, indeed, is this recognised that the
fact has found expression in our liturgy, which bids us pray for
all those who are any wise afflicted &ldquo;in mind, body, or
estate;&rdquo; no inference, therefore, can be more simple and
legitimate than the one in accordance with which the laws that
govern the development of wealth generally are supposed also to
govern the particular form of health and wealth which comes most
closely home to us&mdash;I mean that of our bodily implements or
organs.&nbsp; What is the stomach but a living sack, or purse of
untanned leather, wherein we keep our means of subsistence?&nbsp;
Food is money made easy; it is petty cash in its handiest and
most reduced form; it is our way of assimilating our possessions
and making them indeed our own.&nbsp; What is the purse but a
kind of abridged extra corporeal stomach wherein we keep the
money which we convert by purchase into food, as we presently
convert the food by digestion into flesh and blood?&nbsp; And
what living form is there which is without a purse or stomach,
even though it have to job it by the meal as the am&oelig;ba
does, and exchange it for some other article as soon as it has
done eating?&nbsp; How marvellously does the analogy hold between
the purse and the stomach alike as regards form and function; and
I may say in passing that, as usual, the organ which is the more
remote from protoplasm is at once more special, more an object of
our consciousness, and less an object of its own.</p>
<p>Talk of ego and non ego meeting, and of the hopelessness of
avoiding contradiction in terms&mdash;talk of this, and look, in
passing, at the am&oelig;ba.&nbsp; It is itself <i>qu&acirc;</i>
maker of the stomach and being fed; it is not itself
<i>qu&acirc;</i> stomach and <i>qu&acirc;</i> its using itself as
a mere tool or implement to feed itself with.&nbsp; It is active
and passive, object and subject, <i>ego</i> and <i>non
ego</i>&mdash;every kind of Irish bull, in fact, which a sound
logician abhors&mdash;and it is only because it has persevered,
as I said in &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; in thus defying logic
and arguing most virtuously in a most vicious circle, that it has
come in the persons of some of its descendants to reason with
sufficient soundness.&nbsp; And what the am&oelig;ba is man is
also; man is only a great many am&oelig;bas, most of them
dreadfully narrow-minded, going up and down the country with
their goods and chattels like gipsies in a caravan; he is only a
great many am&oelig;bas that have had much time and money spent
on their education, and received large bequests of organised
intelligence from those that have gone before them.</p>
<p>The most incorporate tool&mdash;we will say an eye, or a
tooth, or the closed fist when used to strike&mdash;has still
something of the <i>non ego</i> about it in so far as it is used;
those organs, again, that are the most completely separate from
the body, as the locomotive engine, must still from time to time
kiss the soil of the human body, and be handled and thus crossed
with man again if they would remain in working order.&nbsp; They
cannot be cut adrift from the most living form of matter (I mean
most living from our point of view), and remain absolutely
without connection with it for any length of time, any more than
a seal can live without coming up sometimes to breathe; and in so
far as they become linked on to living beings they live.&nbsp;
Everything is living which is in close communion with, and
interpermeated by, that something which we call mind or
thought.&nbsp; Giordano Bruno saw this long ago when he made an
interlocutor in one of his dialogues say that a man&rsquo;s hat
and cloak are alive when he is wearing them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy
boots and spurs live,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;when thy feet
carry them; thy hat lives when thy head is within it; and so the
stable lives when it contains the horse or mule, or even
yourself;&rdquo; nor is it easy to see how this is to be refuted
except at a cost which no one in his senses will offer.</p>
<p>It may be said that the life of clothes in wear and implements
in use is no true life, inasmuch as it differs from flesh and
blood life in too many and important respects; that we have made
up our minds about not letting life outside the body too
decisively to allow the question to be reopened; that if this be
tolerated we shall have societies for the prevention of cruelty
to chairs and tables, or cutting clothes amiss, or wearing them
to tatters, or whatever other absurdity may occur to idle and
unkind people; the whole discussion, therefore, should be ordered
out of court at once.</p>
<p>I admit that this is much the most sensible position to take,
but it can only be taken by those who turn the deafest of deaf
ears to the teachings of science, and tolerate no going even for
a moment below the surface of things.&nbsp; People who take this
line must know how to put their foot down firmly in the matter of
closing a discussion.&nbsp; Some one may perhaps innocently say
that some parts of the body are more living and vital than
others, and those who stick to common sense may allow this, but
if they do they must close the discussion on the spot; if they
listen to another syllable they are lost; if they let the
innocent interlocutor say so much as that a piece of
well-nourished healthy brain is more living than the end of a
finger-nail that wants cutting, or than the calcareous parts of a
bone, the solvent will have been applied which will soon make an
end of common sense ways of looking at the matter.&nbsp; Once
even admit the use of the participle &ldquo;dying,&rdquo; which
involves degrees of death, and hence an entry of death in part
into a living body, and common sense must either close the
discussion at once, or ere long surrender at discretion.</p>
<p>Common sense can only carry weight in respect of matters with
which every one is familiar, as forming part of the daily and
hourly conduct of affairs; if we would keep our comfortable hard
and fast lines, our rough and ready unspecialised ways of dealing
with difficult questions, our impatience of what St. Paul calls
&ldquo;doubtful disputations,&rdquo; we must refuse to quit the
ground on which the judgments of mankind have been so long and
often given that they are not likely to be questioned.&nbsp;
Common sense is not yet formulated in manners of science or
philosophy, for only few consider them; few decisions, therefore,
have been arrived at which all hold final.&nbsp; Science is, like
love, &ldquo;too young to know what conscience,&rdquo; or common
sense, is.&nbsp; As soon as the world began to busy itself with
evolution it said good-bye to common sense, and must get on with
uncommon sense as best it can.&nbsp; The first lesson that
uncommon sense will teach it is that contradiction in terms is
the foundation of all sound reasoning&mdash;and, as an obvious
consequence, compromise, the foundation of all sound
practice.&nbsp; This, it follows easily, involves the corollary
that as faith, to be of any value, must be based on reason, so
reason, to be of any value, must be based on faith, and that
neither can stand alone or dispense with the other, any more than
culture or vulgarity can stand unalloyed with one another without
much danger of mischance.</p>
<p>It may not perhaps be immediately apparent why the admission
that a piece of healthy living brain is more living than the end
of a finger-nail, is so dangerous to common sense ways of looking
at life and death; I had better, therefore, be more
explicit.&nbsp; By this admission degrees of livingness are
admitted within the body; this involves approaches to
non-livingness.&nbsp; On this the question arises, &ldquo;Which
are the most living parts?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer to this was
given a few years ago with a flourish of trumpets, and our
biologists shouted with one voice, &ldquo;Great is
protoplasm.&nbsp; There is no life but protoplasm, and Huxley is
its prophet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Read Huxley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Physical
Basis of Mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Read Professor Mivart&rsquo;s
article, &ldquo;What are Living Beings?&rdquo; in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, July, 1879.&nbsp; Read Dr. Andrew
Wilson&rsquo;s article in the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
October, 1879.&nbsp; Remember Professor Allman&rsquo;s address to
the British Association, 1879; ask, again, any medical man what
is the most approved scientific attitude as regards the
protoplasmic and non-protoplasmic parts of the body, and he will
say that the thinly veiled conclusion arrived at by all of them
is, that the protoplasmic parts are alone truly living, and that
the non-protoplasmic are non-living.</p>
<p>It may suffice if I confine myself to Professor Allman&rsquo;s
address to the British Association in 1879, as a representative
utterance.&nbsp; Professor Allman said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protoplasm lies at the base of every vital
phenomenon.&nbsp; It is, as Huxley has well expressed it,
&lsquo;the physical basis of life;&rsquo; wherever there is life
from its lowest to its highest manifestation there is protoplasm;
wherever there is protoplasm there is life.&rdquo; <a
name="citation122a"></a><a href="#footnote122a"
class="citation">[122a]</a></p>
<p>To say wherever there is life there is protoplasm, is to say
that there can be no life without protoplasm, and this is saying
that where there is no protoplasm there is no life.&nbsp; But
large parts of the body are non-protoplasmic; a bone is, indeed,
permeated by protoplasm, but it is not protoplasm; it follows,
therefore, that according to Professor Allman bone is not in any
proper sense of words a living substance.&nbsp; From this it
should follow, and doubtless does follow in Professor
Allman&rsquo;s mind, that large tracts of the human body, if not
the greater part by weight (as bones, skin, muscular tissues,
&amp;c.), are no more alive than a coat or pair of boots in wear
is alive, except in so far as the bones, &amp;c., are more
closely and nakedly permeated by protoplasm than the coat or
boots, and are thus brought into closer, directer, and more
permanent communication with that which, if not life itself,
still has more of the ear of life, and comes nearer to its royal
person than anything else does.&nbsp; Indeed that this is
Professor Allman&rsquo;s opinion appears from the passage on page
26 of the report, in which he says that in &ldquo;protoplasm we
find the only form of matter in which life can manifest
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to this view the skin and other tissues are supposed
to be made from dead protoplasm which living protoplasm turns to
account as the British Museum authorities are believed to stuff
their new specimens with the skins of old ones; the matter used
by the living protoplasm for this purpose is held to be entirely
foreign to protoplasm itself, and no more capable of acting in
concert with it than bricks can understand and act in concert
with the bricklayer.&nbsp; As the bricklayer is held to be living
and the bricks non-living, so the bones and skin which protoplasm
is supposed to construct are held non-living and the protoplasm
alone living.&nbsp; Protoplasm, it is said, goes about masked
behind the clothes or habits which it has fashioned.&nbsp; It has
habited itself as animals and plants, and we have mistaken the
garment for the wearer&mdash;as our dogs and cats doubtless think
with Giordano Bruno that our boots live when we are wearing them,
and that we keep spare paws in our bedrooms which lie by the wall
and go to sleep when we have not got them on.</p>
<p>If, in answer to the assertion that the osseous parts of bone
are non-living, it is said that they must be living, for they
heal if broken, which no dead matter can do, it is answered that
the broken pieces of bone do not grow together; they are mended
by the protoplasm which permeates the Haversian canals; the bones
themselves are no more living merely because they are tenanted by
something which really does live, than a house lives because men
and women inhabit it; and if a bone is repaired, it no more
repairs itself than a house can be said to have repaired itself
because its owner has sent for the bricklayer and seen that what
was wanted was done.</p>
<p>We do not know, it is said, by what means the structureless
viscid substance which we call protoplasm can build for itself a
solid bone; we do not understand how an am&oelig;ba makes its
test; no one understands how anything is done unless he can do it
himself; and even then he probably does not know how he has done
it.&nbsp; Set a man who has never painted, to watch Rembrandt
paint the Burgomaster Six, and he will no more understand how
Rembrandt can have done it, than we can understand how the
am&oelig;ba makes its test, or the protoplasm cements two broken
ends of a piece of bone.&nbsp; <i>Ces choses se font mais ne
s&rsquo;expliquent pas</i>.&nbsp; So some denizen of another
planet looking at our earth through a telescope which showed him
much, but still not quite enough, and seeing the St. Gothard
tunnel plumb on end so that he could not see the holes of entry
and exit, would think the trains there a kind of caterpillar
which went through the mountain by a pure effort of the
will&mdash;that enabled them in some mysterious way to disregard
material obstacles and dispense with material means.&nbsp; We
know, of course, that it is not so, and that exemption from the
toil attendant on material obstacles has been compounded for, in
the ordinary way, by the single payment of a tunnel; and so with
the cementing of a bone, our biologists say that the protoplasm,
which is alone living, cements it much as a man might mend a
piece of broken china, but that it works by methods and processes
which elude us, even as the holes of the St. Gothard tunnel may
be supposed to elude a denizen of another world.</p>
<p>The reader will already have seen that the toils are beginning
to close round those who, while professing to be guided by common
sense, still parley with even the most superficial probers
beneath the surface; this, however, will appear more clearly in
the following chapter.&nbsp; It will also appear how far-reaching
were the consequences of the denial of design that was involved
in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory that luck is the main element in
survival, and how largely this theory is responsible for the
fatuous developments in connection alike with protoplasm and
automatism which a few years ago seemed about to carry everything
before them.</p>
<h2><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Chapter IX<br />
Property, Common Sense, and Protoplasm (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> position, then, stands
thus.&nbsp; Common sense gave the inch of admitting some parts of
the body to be less living than others, and philosophy took the
ell of declaring the body to be almost all of it stone
dead.&nbsp; This is serious; still if it were all, for a quiet
life, we might put up with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately we know only
too well that it will not be all.&nbsp; Our bodies, which seemed
so living and now prove so dead, have served us such a trick that
we can have no confidence in anything connected with them.&nbsp;
As with skin and bones to-day, so with protoplasm
to-morrow.&nbsp; Protoplasm is mainly oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and carbon; if we do not keep a sharp look out, we shall have it
going the way of the rest of the body, and being declared dead in
respect, at any rate, of these inorganic components.&nbsp;
Science has not, I believe, settled all the components of
protoplasm, but this is neither here nor there; she has settled
what it is in great part, and there is no trusting her not to
settle the rest at any moment, even if she has not already done
so.&nbsp; As soon as this has been done we shall be told that
nine-tenths of the protoplasm of which we are composed must go
the way of our non-protoplasmic parts, and that the only really
living part of us is the something with a new name that runs the
protoplasm that runs the flesh and bones that run the
organs&mdash;</p>
<p>Why stop here?&nbsp; Why not add &ldquo;which run the tools
and properties which are as essential to our life and health as
much that is actually incorporate with us?&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
breach which has let the non-living effect a lodgment within the
body must, in all equity, let the organic
character&mdash;bodiliness, so to speak&mdash;pass out beyond its
limits and effect a lodgment in our temporary and extra-corporeal
limbs.&nbsp; What, on the protoplasmic theory, the skin and bones
are, that the hammer and spade are also; they differ in the
degree of closeness and permanence with which they are associated
with protoplasm, but both bones and hammers are alike non-living
things which protoplasm uses for its own purposes and keeps
closer or less close at hand as custom and convenience may
determine.</p>
<p>According to this view, the non-protoplasmic parts of the body
are tools of the first degree; they are not living, but they are
in such close and constant contact with that which really lives,
that an aroma of life attaches to them.&nbsp; Some of these,
however, such as horns, hooves, and tusks, are so little
permeated by protoplasm that they cannot rank much higher than
the tools of the second degree, which come next to them in
order.</p>
<p>These tools of the second degree are either picked up
ready-made, or are manufactured directly by the body, as being
torn or bitten into shape, or as stones picked up to throw at
prey or at an enemy.</p>
<p>Tools of the third degree are made by the instrumentality of
tools of the second and first degrees; as, for example, chipped
flint, arrow-heads, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Tools of the fourth degree are made by those of the third,
second, and first.&nbsp; They consist of the simpler compound
instruments that yet require to be worked by hand, as hammers,
spades, and even hand flour-mills.</p>
<p>Tools of the fifth degree are made by the help of those of the
fourth, third, second, and first.&nbsp; They are compounded of
many tools, worked, it may be, by steam or water and requiring no
constant contact with the body.</p>
<p>But each one of these tools of the fifth degree was made in
the first instance by the sole instrumentality of the four
preceding kinds of tool.&nbsp; They must all be linked on to
protoplasm, which is the one original tool-maker, but which can
only make the tools that are more remote from itself by the help
of those that are nearer, that is to say, it can only work when
it has suitable tools to work with, and when it is allowed to use
them in its own way.&nbsp; There can be no direct communication
between protoplasm and a steam-engine; there may be and often is
direct communication between machines of even the fifth order and
those of the first, as when an engine-man turns a cock, or
repairs something with his own hands if he has nothing better to
work with.&nbsp; But put a hammer, for example, to a piece of
protoplasm, and the protoplasm will no more know what to do with
it than we should be able to saw a piece of wood in two without a
saw.&nbsp; Even protoplasm from the hand of a carpenter who has
been handling hammers all his life would be hopelessly put off
its stroke if not allowed to work in its usual way but put bare
up against a hammer; it would make a slimy mess and then dry up;
still there can be no doubt (so at least those who uphold
protoplasm as the one living substance would say) that the closer
a machine can be got to protoplasm and the more permanent the
connection, the more living it appears to be, or at any rate the
more does it appear to be endowed with spontaneous and reasoning
energy, so long, of course, as the closeness is of a kind which
protoplasm understands and is familiar with.&nbsp; This, they
say, is why we do not like using any implement or tool with
gloves on, for these impose a barrier between the tool and its
true connection with protoplasm by means of the nervous
system.&nbsp; For the same reason we put gloves on when we box so
as to bar the connection.</p>
<p>That which we handle most unglovedly is our food, which we
handle with our stomachs rather than with our hands.&nbsp; Our
hands are so thickly encased with skin that protoplasm can hold
but small conversation with what they contain, unless it be held
for a long time in the closed fist, and even so the converse is
impeded as in a strange language; the inside of our mouths is
more naked, and our stomachs are more naked still; it is here
that protoplasm brings its fullest powers of suasion to bear on
those whom it would proselytise and receive as it were into its
own communion&mdash;whom it would convert and bring into a
condition of mind in which they shall see things as it sees them
itself, and, as we commonly say, &ldquo;agree with&rdquo; it,
instead of standing out stiffly for their own opinion.&nbsp; We
call this digesting our food; more properly we should call it
being digested by our food, which reads, marks, learns, and
inwardly digests us, till it comes to understand us and encourage
us by assuring us that we were perfectly right all the time, no
matter what any one might have said, or say, to the
contrary.&nbsp; Having thus recanted all its own past heresies,
it sets to work to convert everything that comes near it and
seems in the least likely to be converted.&nbsp; Eating is a mode
of love; it is an effort after a closer union; so we say we love
roast beef.&nbsp; A French lady told me once that she adored
veal; and a nurse tells her child that she would like to eat
it.&nbsp; Even he who caresses a dog or horse <i>pro tanto</i>
both weds and eats it.&nbsp; Strange how close the analogy
between love and hunger; in each case the effort is after closer
union and possession; in each case the outcome is reproduction
(for nutrition is the most complete of reproductions), and in
each case there are <i>residua</i>.&nbsp; But to return.</p>
<p>I have shown above that one consequence of the attempt so
vigorously made a few years ago to establish protoplasm as the
one living substance, is the making it clear that the
non-protoplasmic parts of the body and the simpler
extra-corporeal tools or organs must run on all fours in the
matter of livingness and non-livingness.&nbsp; If the
protoplasmic parts of the body are held living in virtue of their
being used by something that really lives, then so, though in a
less degree, must tools and machines.&nbsp; If, on the other
hand, tools and machines are held non-living inasmuch as they
only owe what little appearance of life they may present when in
actual use to something else that lives, and have no life of
their own&mdash;so, though in a less degree, must the
non-protoplasmic parts of the body.&nbsp; Allow an overflowing
aroma of life to vivify the horny skin under the heel, and from
this there will be a spilling which will vivify the boot in
wear.&nbsp; Deny an aroma of life to the boot in wear, and it
must ere long be denied to ninety-nine per cent. of the body; and
if the body is not alive while it can walk and talk, what in the
name of all that is unreasonable can be held to be so?</p>
<p>That the essential identity of bodily organs and tools is no
ingenious paradoxical way of putting things is evident from the
fact that we speak of bodily organs at all.&nbsp; Organ means
tool.&nbsp; There is nothing which reveals our most genuine
opinions to us so unerringly as our habitual and unguarded
expressions, and in the case under consideration so completely do
we instinctively recognise the underlying identity of tools and
limbs, that scientific men use the word &ldquo;organ&rdquo; for
any part of the body that discharges a function, practically to
the exclusion of any other term.&nbsp; Of course, however, the
above contention as to the essential identity of tools and organs
does not involve a denial of their obvious superficial
differences&mdash;differences so many and so great as to justify
our classing them in distinct categories so long as we have
regard to the daily purposes of life without looking at remoter
ones.</p>
<p>If the above be admitted, we can reply to those who in an
earlier chapter objected to our saying that if Mr. Darwin denied
design in the eye he should deny it in the burglar&rsquo;s jemmy
also.&nbsp; For if bodily and non-bodily organs are essentially
one in kind, being each of them both living and non-living, and
each of them only a higher development of principles already
admitted and largely acted on in the other, then the method of
procedure observable in the evolution of the organs whose history
is within our ken should throw light upon the evolution of that
whose history goes back into so dim a past that we can only know
it by way of inference.&nbsp; In the absence of any show of
reason to the contrary we should argue from the known to the
unknown, and presume that even as our non-bodily organs
originated and were developed through gradual accumulation of
design, effort, and contrivance guided by experience, so also
must our bodily organs have been, in spite of the fact that the
contrivance has been, as it were, denuded of external evidences
in the course of long time.&nbsp; This at least is the most
obvious inference to draw; the burden of proof should rest not
with those who uphold function as the most important means of
organic modification, but with those who impugn it; it is hardly
necessary, however, to say that Mr. Darwin never attempted to
impugn by way of argument the conclusions either of his
grandfather or of Lamarck.&nbsp; He waved them both aside in one
or two short semi-contemptuous sentences, and said no more about
them&mdash;not, at least, until late in life he wrote his
&ldquo;Erasmus Darwin,&rdquo; and even then his remarks were
purely biographical; he did not say one syllable by way of
refutation, or even of explanation.</p>
<p>I am free to confess that, overwhelming as is the evidence
brought forward by Mr. Spencer in the articles already referred
to, as showing that accidental variations, unguided by the helm
of any main general principle which should as it were keep their
heads straight, could never accumulate with the results supposed
by Mr. Darwin; and overwhelming, again, as is the consideration
that Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s most crushing argument was allowed by
Mr. Darwin to go without reply, still the considerations arising
from the discoveries of the last forty years or so in connection
with protoplasm, seem to me almost more overwhelming still.&nbsp;
This evidence proceeds on different lines from that adduced by
Mr. Spencer, but it points to the same conclusion, namely, that
though luck will avail much if backed by cunning and experience,
it is unavailing for any permanent result without them.&nbsp;
There is an irony which seems almost always to attend on those
who maintain that protoplasm is the only living substance which
ere long points their conclusions the opposite way to that which
they desire&mdash;in the very last direction, indeed, in which
they of all people in the world would willingly see them
pointed.</p>
<p>It may be asked why I should have so strong an objection to
seeing protoplasm as the only living substance, when I find this
view so useful to me as tending to substantiate
design&mdash;which I admit that I have as much and as seriously
at heart as I can allow myself to have any matter which, after
all, can so little affect daily conduct; I reply that it is no
part of my business to inquire whether this or that makes for my
pet theories or against them; my concern is to inquire whether or
no it is borne out by facts, and I find the opinion that
protoplasm is the one living substance unstable, inasmuch as it
is an attempt to make a halt where no halt can be made.&nbsp;
This is enough; but, furthermore, the fact that the protoplasmic
parts of the body are <i>more</i> living than the
non-protoplasmic&mdash;which I cannot deny, without denying that
it is any longer convenient to think of life and death at
all&mdash;will answer my purpose to the full as well or
better.</p>
<p>I pointed out another consequence, which, again, was cruelly
the reverse of what the promoters of the protoplasm movement
might be supposed anxious to arrive at&mdash;in a series of
articles which appeared in the <i>Examiner</i> during the summer
of 1879, and showed that if protoplasm were held to be the sole
seat of life, then this unity in the substance vivifying all,
both animals and plants, must be held as uniting them into a
single corporation or body&mdash;especially when their community
of descent is borne in mind&mdash;more effectually than any
merely superficial separation into individuals can be held to
disunite them, and that thus protoplasm must be seen as the life
of the world&mdash;as a vast body corporate, never dying till the
earth itself shall pass away.&nbsp; This came practically to
saying that protoplasm was God Almighty, who, of all the forms
open to Him, had chosen this singularly unattractive one as the
channel through which to make Himself manifest in the flesh by
taking our nature upon Him, and animating us with His own
Spirit.&nbsp; Our biologists, in fact, were fast nearing the
conception of a God who was both personal and material, but who
could not be made to square with pantheistic notions inasmuch as
no provision was made for the inorganic world; and, indeed, they
seem to have become alarmed at the grotesqueness of the position
in which they must ere long have found themselves, for in the
autumn of 1879 the boom collapsed, and thenceforth the leading
reviews and magazines have known protoplasm no more.&nbsp; About
the same time bathybius, which at one time bade fair to supplant
it upon the throne of popularity, died suddenly, as I am told, at
Norwich, under circumstances which did not transpire, nor has its
name, so far as I am aware, been ever again mentioned.</p>
<p>So much for the conclusions in regard to the larger aspect of
life taken as a whole which must follow from confining life to
protoplasm; but there is another aspect&mdash;that, namely, which
regards the individual.&nbsp; The inevitable consequences of
confining life to the protoplasmic parts of the body were just as
unexpected and unwelcome here as they had been with regard to
life at large; for, as I have already pointed out, there is no
drawing the line at protoplasm and resting at this point; nor yet
at the next halting-point beyond; nor at the one beyond
that.&nbsp; How often is this process to be repeated? and in what
can it end but in the rehabilitation of the soul as an ethereal,
spiritual, vital principle, apart from matter, which,
nevertheless, it animates, vivifying the clay of our
bodies?&nbsp; No one who has followed the course either of
biology or psychology during this century, and more especially
during the last five-and-twenty years, will tolerate the
reintroduction of the soul as something apart from the substratum
in which both feeling and action must be held to inhere.&nbsp;
The notion of matter being ever changed except by other matter in
another state is so shocking to the intellectual conscience that
it may be dismissed without discussion; yet if bathybius had not
been promptly dealt with, it must have become apparent even to
the British public that there were indeed but few steps from
protoplasm, as the only living substance, to vital
principle.&nbsp; Our biologists therefore stifled bathybius,
perhaps with justice, certainly with prudence, and left
protoplasm to its fate.</p>
<p>Any one who reads Professor Allman&rsquo;s address above
referred to with due care will see that he was uneasy about
protoplasm, even at the time of its greatest popularity.&nbsp;
Professor Allman never says outright that the non-protoplasmic
parts of the body are no more alive than chairs and tables
are.&nbsp; He said what involved this as an inevitable
consequence, and there can be no doubt that this is what he
wanted to convey, but he never insisted on it with the
outspokenness and emphasis with which so startling a paradox
should alone be offered us for acceptance; nor is it easy to
believe that his reluctance to express his conclusion <i>totidem
verbis</i> was not due to a sense that it might ere long prove
more convenient not to have done so.&nbsp; When I advocated the
theory of the livingness, or quasi-livingness of machines, in the
chapters of &ldquo;Erewhon&rdquo; of which all else that I have
written on biological subjects is a development, I took care that
people should see the position in its extreme form; the
non-livingness of bodily organs is to the full as startling a
paradox as the livingness of non-bodily ones, and we have a right
to expect the fullest explicitness from those who advance
it.&nbsp; Of course it must be borne in mind that a machine can
only claim any appreciable even aroma of livingness so long as it
is in actual use.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Erewhon&rdquo; I did not think
it necessary to insist on this, and did not, indeed, yet fully
know what I was driving at.</p>
<p>The same disposition to avoid committing themselves to the
assertion that any part of the body is non-living may be observed
in the writings of the other authorities upon protoplasm above
referred to; I have searched all they said, and cannot find a
single passage in which they declare even the osseous parts of a
bone to be non-living, though this conclusion was the <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of all they were saying and followed as an
obvious inference.&nbsp; The reader will probably agree with me
in thinking that such reticence can only have been due to a
feeling that the ground was one on which it behoved them to walk
circumspectly; they probably felt, after a vague, ill-defined
fashion, that the more they reduced the body to mechanism the
more they laid it open to an opponent to raise mechanism to the
body, but, however this may be, they dropped protoplasm, as I
have said, in some haste with the autumn of 1879.</p>

The Attempt to Eliminate Mind</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span>, it may be asked, were our
biologists really aiming at?&mdash;for men like Professor Huxley
do not serve protoplasm for nought.&nbsp; They wanted a good many
things, some of them more righteous than others, but all
intelligible.&nbsp; Among the more lawful of their desires was a
craving after a monistic conception of the universe.&nbsp; We all
desire this; who can turn his thoughts to these matters at all
and not instinctively lean towards the old conception of one
supreme and ultimate essence as the source from which all things
proceed and have proceeded, both now and ever?&nbsp; The most
striking and apparently most stable theory of the last quarter of
a century had been Sir William Grove&rsquo;s theory of the
conservation of energy; and yet wherein is there any substantial
difference between this recent outcome of modern amateur, and
hence most sincere, science&mdash;pointing as it does to an
imperishable, and as such unchangeable, and as such, again, for
ever unknowable underlying substance the modes of which alone
change&mdash;wherein, except in mere verbal costume, does this
differ from the conclusions arrived at by the psalmist?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of old,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;hast Thou laid the
foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of Thy
hands.&nbsp; They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; yea, all
of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou
change them and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same, and
Thy years shall have no end.&rdquo; <a name="citation135a"></a><a
href="#footnote135a" class="citation">[135a]</a></p>
<p>I know not what theologians may think of this passage, but
from a scientific point of view it is unassailable.&nbsp; So
again, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;Thou hast
searched me out, and known me: Thou knowest my down-sitting and
mine up-rising; Thou understandest my thoughts long before.&nbsp;
Thou art about my path, and about my bed: and spiest out all my
ways.&nbsp; For lo, there is not a word in my tongue but Thou, O
Lord, knowest it altogether . . . Whither shall I go, then, from
Thy Spirit?&nbsp; Or whither shall I go, then, from Thy
presence?&nbsp; If I climb up into heaven Thou art there: if I go
down to hell, Thou art there also.&nbsp; If I take the wings of
the morning, and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea, even
there also shall Thy hand lead me and Thy right hand shall hold
me.&nbsp; If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me,
then shall my night be turned to day.&nbsp; Yea, the darkness is
no darkness with Thee, but . . . the darkness and light to Thee
are both alike.&rdquo; <a name="citation136a"></a><a
href="#footnote136a" class="citation">[136a]</a></p>
<p>What convention or short cut can symbolise for us the results
of laboured and complicated chains of reasoning or bring them
more aptly and concisely home to us than the one supplied long
since by the word God?&nbsp; What can approach more nearly to a
rendering of that which cannot be rendered&mdash;the idea of an
essence omnipresent in all things at all times everywhere in sky
and earth and sea; ever changing, yet the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever; the ineffable contradiction in terms whose presence
none can either ever enter, or ever escape?&nbsp; Or rather, what
convention would have been more apt if it had not been lost sight
of as a convention and come to be regarded as an idea in actual
correspondence with a more or less knowable reality?&nbsp; A
convention was converted into a fetish, and now that its
worthlessness as a fetish is being generally felt, its great
value as a hieroglyph or convention is in danger of being lost
sight of.&nbsp; No doubt the psalmist was seeking for Sir William
Grove&rsquo;s conception, if haply he might feel after it and
find it, and assuredly it is not far from every one of us.&nbsp;
But the course of true philosophy never did run smooth; no sooner
have we fairly grasped the conception of a single eternal and for
ever unknowable underlying substance, then we are faced by mind
and matter.&nbsp; Long-standing ideas and current language alike
lead us to see these as distinct things&mdash;mind being still
commonly regarded as something that acts on body from without as
the wind blows upon a leaf, and as no less an actual entity than
the body.&nbsp; Neither body nor mind seems less essential to our
existence than the other; not only do we feel this as regards our
own existence, but we feel it also as pervading the whole world
of life; everywhere we see body and mind working together towards
results that must be ascribed equally to both; but they are two,
not one; if, then, we are to have our monistic conception, it
would seem as though one of these must yield to the other; which,
therefore, is it to be?</p>
<p>This is a very old question.&nbsp; Some, from time immemorial,
have tried to get rid of matter by reducing it to a mere concept
of the mind, and their followers have arrived at conclusions that
may be logically irrefragable, but are as far removed from common
sense as they are in accord with logic; at any rate they have
failed to satisfy, and matter is no nearer being got rid of now
than it was when the discussion first began.&nbsp; Others, again,
have tried materialism, have declared the causative action of
both thought and feeling to be deceptive, and posit matter
obeying fixed laws of which thought and feeling must be admitted
as concomitants, but with which they have no causal
connection.&nbsp; The same thing has happened to these men as to
their opponents; they made out an excellent case on paper, but
thought and feeling still remain the mainsprings of action that
they have been always held to be.&nbsp; We still say, &ldquo;I
gave him &pound;5 because I felt pleased with him, and thought he
would like it;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I knocked him down because I
felt angry, and thought I would teach him better
manners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Omnipresent life and mind with appearances
of brute non-livingness&mdash;which appearances are deceptive;
this is one view.&nbsp; Omnipresent non-livingness or mechanism
with appearances as though the mechanism were guided and
controlled by thought&mdash;which appearances are deceptive; this
is the other.&nbsp; Between these two views the slaves of logic
have oscillated for centuries, and to all appearance will
continue to oscillate for centuries more.</p>
<p>People who think&mdash;as against those who feel and
act&mdash;want hard and fast lines&mdash;without which, indeed,
they cannot think at all; these lines are as it were steps cut on
a slope of ice without which there would be no descending
it.&nbsp; When we have begun to travel the downward path of
thought, we ask ourselves questions about life and death, ego and
non ego, object and subject, necessity and free will, and other
kindred subjects.&nbsp; We want to know where we are, and in the
hope of simplifying matters, strip, as it were, each subject to
the skin, and finding that even this has not freed it from all
extraneous matter, flay it alive in the hope that if we grub down
deep enough we shall come upon it in its pure unalloyed state
free from all inconvenient complication through intermixture with
anything alien to itself.&nbsp; Then, indeed, we can docket it,
and pigeon-hole it for what it is; but what can we do with it
till we have got it pure?&nbsp; We want to account for things,
which means that we want to know to which of the various accounts
opened in our mental ledger we ought to carry them&mdash;and how
can we do this if we admit a phenomenon to be neither one thing
nor the other, but to belong to half-a-dozen different accounts
in proportions which often cannot even approximately be
determined?&nbsp; If we are to keep accounts we must keep them in
reasonable compass; and if keeping them within reasonable compass
involves something of a Procrustean arrangement, we may regret
it, but cannot help it; having set up as thinkers we have got to
think, and must adhere to the only conditions under which thought
is possible; life, therefore, must be life, all life, and nothing
but life, and so with death, free will, necessity, design, and
everything else.&nbsp; This, at least, is how philosophers must
think concerning them in theory; in practice, however, not even
John Stuart Mill himself could eliminate all taint of its
opposite from any one of these things, any more than Lady Macbeth
could clear her hand of blood; indeed, the more nearly we think
we have succeeded the more certain are we to find ourselves ere
long mocked and baffled; and this, I take it, is what our
biologists began in the autumn of 1879 to discover had happened
to themselves.</p>
<p>For some years they had been trying to get rid of feeling,
consciousness, and mind generally, from active participation in
the evolution of the universe.&nbsp; They admitted, indeed, that
feeling and consciousness attend the working of the world&rsquo;s
gear, as noise attends the working of a steam-engine, but they
would not allow that consciousness produced more effect in the
working of the world than noise on that of the
steam-engine.&nbsp; Feeling and noise were alike accidental
unessential adjuncts and nothing more.&nbsp; Incredible as it may
seem to those who are happy enough not to know that this attempt
is an old one, they were trying to reduce the world to the level
of a piece of unerring though sentient mechanism.&nbsp; Men and
animals must be allowed to feel and even to reflect; this much
must be conceded, but granted that they do, still (so, at least,
it was contended) it has no effect upon the result; it does not
matter as far as this is concerned whether they feel and think or
not; everything would go on exactly as it does and always has
done, though neither man nor beast knew nor felt anything at
all.&nbsp; It is only by maintaining things like this that people
will get pensions out of the British public.</p>
<p>Some such position as this is a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> for
the Neo-Darwinistic doctrine of natural selection, which, as Von
Hartmann justly observes, involves an essentially mechanical
mindless conception of the universe; to natural selection&rsquo;s
door, therefore, the blame of the whole movement in favour of
mechanism must be justly laid.&nbsp; It was natural that those
who had been foremost in preaching mindless designless luck as
the main means of organic modification, should lend themselves
with alacrity to the task of getting rid of thought and feeling
from all share in the direction and governance of the
world.&nbsp; Professor Huxley, as usual, was among the foremost
in this good work, and whether influenced by Hobbes, or
Descartes, or Mr. Spalding, or even by the machine chapters in
&ldquo;Erewhon&rdquo; which were still recent, I do not know, led
off with his article &ldquo;On the hypothesis that animals are
automata&rdquo; (which it may be observed is the exact converse
of the hypothesis that automata are animated) in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> for November 1874.&nbsp; Professor
Huxley did not say outright that men and women were just as
living and just as dead as their own watches, but this was what
his article came to in substance.&nbsp; The conclusion arrived at
was that animals were automata; true, they were probably
sentient, still they were automata pure and simple, mere sentient
pieces of exceedingly elaborate clockwork, and nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Huxley,&rdquo; says Mr. Romanes, in his Rede
Lecture for 1885, <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a> &ldquo;argues by
way of perfectly logical deduction from this statement, that
thought and feeling have nothing to do with determining action;
they are merely the bye-products of cerebration, or, as he
expresses it, the indices of changes which are going on in the
brain.&nbsp; Under this view we are all what he terms conscious
automata, or machines which happen, as it were by chance, to be
conscious of some of their own movements.&nbsp; But the
consciousness is altogether adventitious, and bears the same
ineffectual relation to the activity of the brain as a steam
whistle bears to the activity of a locomotive, or the striking of
a clock to the time-keeping adjustments of the clockwork.&nbsp;
Here, again, we meet with an echo of Hobbes, who opens his work
on the commonwealth with these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nature, the art whereby God hath made and
governs the world, is by the <i>art</i> of man, as in many other
things, in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial
animal.&nbsp; For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the
beginning whereof is in the principal part within; why may we not
say that all automata (engines that move themselves by springs
and wheels as doth a watch) have an artificial life?&nbsp; For
what is the <i>heart</i> but a spring, and the <i>nerves</i> but
so many <i>strings</i>; and the <i>joints</i> but so many
<i>wheels</i> giving motion to the whole body, such as was
intended by the artificer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this theory of conscious automatism is not merely a
legitimate outcome of the theory that nervous changes are the
causes of mental changes, but it is logically the only possible
outcome.&nbsp; Nor do I see any way in which this theory can be
fought on grounds of physiology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In passing, I may say the theory that living beings are
conscious machines, can be fought just as much and just as little
as the theory that machines are unconscious living beings;
everything that goes to prove either of these propositions goes
just as well to prove the other also.&nbsp; But I have perhaps
already said as much as is necessary on this head; the main point
with which I am concerned is the fact that Professor Huxley was
trying to expel consciousness and sentience from any causative
action in the working of the universe.&nbsp; In the following
month appeared the late Professor Clifford&rsquo;s hardly less
outspoken article, &ldquo;Body and Mind,&rdquo; to the same
effect, also in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, then edited by Mr.
John Morley.&nbsp; Perhaps this view attained its frankest
expression in an article by the late Mr. Spalding, which appeared
in <i>Nature</i>, August 2, 1877; the following extracts will
show that Mr. Spalding must be credited with not playing fast and
loose with his own conclusions, and knew both how to think a
thing out to its extreme consequences, and how to put those
consequences clearly before his readers.&nbsp; Mr. Spalding
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against Mr. Lewes&rsquo;s proposition that the
movements of living beings are prompted and guided by feeling, I
urged that the amount and direction of every nervous discharge
must depend solely on physical conditions.&nbsp; And I contended
that to see this clearly is to see that when we speak of movement
being guided by feeling, we use the language of a less advanced
stage of enlightenment.&nbsp; This view has since occupied a good
deal of attention.&nbsp; Under the name of automatism it has been
advocated by Professor Huxley, and with firmer logic by Professor
Clifford.&nbsp; In the minds of our savage ancestors feeling was
the source of all movement . . . Using the word feeling in its
ordinary sense . . . <i>we assert not only that no evidence can
be given that feeling ever does guide or prompt action</i>,
<i>but that the process of its doing so is
inconceivable</i>.&nbsp; (Italics mine.)&nbsp; How can we picture
to ourselves a state of consciousness putting in motion any
particle of matter, large or small?&nbsp; Puss, while dozing
before the fire, hears a light rustle in the corner, and darts
towards the spot.&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp; Certain
sound-waves have reached the ear, a series of physical changes
have taken place within the organism, special groups of muscles
have been called into play, and the body of the cat has changed
its position on the floor.&nbsp; Is it asserted that this chain
of physical changes is not at all points complete and sufficient
in itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been led to turn to this article of Mr.
Spalding&rsquo;s by Mr. Stewart Duncan, who, in his
&ldquo;Conscious Matter,&rdquo; <a name="citation142a"></a><a
href="#footnote142a" class="citation">[142a]</a> quotes the
latter part of the foregoing extract.&nbsp; Mr. Duncan goes on to
quote passages from Professor Tyndall&rsquo;s utterances of about
the same date which show that he too took much the same
line&mdash;namely, that there is no causative connection between
mental and physical processes; from this it is obvious he must
have supposed that physical processes would go on just as well if
there were no accompaniment of feeling and consciousness at
all.</p>
<p>I have said enough to show that in the decade, roughly,
between 1870 and 1880 the set of opinion among our leading
biologists was strongly against mind, as having in any way
influenced the development of animal and vegetable life, and it
is not likely to be denied that the prominence which the mindless
theory of natural selection had assumed in men&rsquo;s thoughts
since 1860 was one of the chief reasons, if not the chief, for
the turn opinion was taking.&nbsp; Our leading biologists had
staked so heavily upon natural selection from among fortuitous
variations that they would have been more than human if they had
not caught at everything that seemed to give it colour and
support.&nbsp; It was while this mechanical fit was upon them,
and in the closest connection with it, that the protoplasm boom
developed.&nbsp; It was doubtless felt that if the public could
be got to dislodge life, consciousness, and mind from any
considerable part of the body, it would be no hard matter to
dislodge it, presently, from the remainder; on this the
deceptiveness of mind as a causative agent, and the sufficiency
of a purely automatic conception of the universe, as of something
that will work if a penny be dropped into the box, would be
proved to demonstration.&nbsp; It would be proved from the side
of mind by considerations derivable from automatic and
unconscious action where mind <i>ex hypothesi</i> was not, but
where action went on as well or better without it than with it;
it would be proved from the side of body by what they would
doubtless call the &ldquo;most careful and exhaustive&rdquo;
examination of the body itself by the aid of appliances more
ample than had ever before been within the reach of man.</p>
<p>This was all very well, but for its success one thing was a
<i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>&mdash;I mean the dislodgment must be
thorough; the key must be got clean of even the smallest trace of
blood, for unless this could be done all the argument went to the
profit not of the mechanism, with which, for some reason or
other, they were so much enamoured, but of the soul and design,
the ideas which of all others were most distasteful to
them.&nbsp; They shut their eyes to this for a long time, but in
the end appear to have seen that if they were in search of an
absolute living and absolute non-living, the path along which
they were travelling would never lead them to it.&nbsp; They were
driving life up into a corner, but they were not eliminating it,
and, moreover, at the very moment of their thinking they had
hedged it in and could throw their salt upon it, it flew
mockingly over their heads and perched upon the place of all
others where they were most scandalised to see it&mdash;I mean
upon machines in use.&nbsp; So they retired sulkily to their
tents baffled but not ashamed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some months subsequent to the completion of the foregoing
chapter, and indeed just as this book is on the point of leaving
my hands, there appears in <i>Nature</i> <a
name="citation144a"></a><a href="#footnote144a"
class="citation">[144a]</a> a letter from the Duke of Argyll,
which shows that he too is impressed with the conviction
expressed above&mdash;I mean that the real object our men of
science have lately had in view has been the getting rid of mind
from among the causes of evolution.&nbsp; The Duke
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The violence with which false interpretations were put
upon this theory (natural selection) and a function was assigned
to it which it could never fulfil, will some day be recognised as
one of the least creditable episodes in the history of
science.&nbsp; With a curious perversity it was the weakest
elements in the theory which were seized upon as the most
valuable, particularly the part assigned to blind chance in the
occurrence of variations.&nbsp; This was valued not for its
scientific truth,&mdash;for it could pretend to none,&mdash;but
because of its assumed bearing upon another field of thought and
the weapon it afforded for expelling mind from the causes of
evolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke, speaking of Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s two articles
in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> for April and May, 1886, to
which I have already called attention, continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these two articles we have for the first time an
avowed and definite declaration against some of the leading ideas
on which the mechanical philosophy depends; and yet the caution,
and almost timidity, with which a man so eminent approaches the
announcement of conclusions of the most self-evident truth is a
most curious proof of the reign of terror which has come to be
established.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against this I must protest; the Duke cannot seriously
maintain that the main scope and purpose of Mr. Herbert
Spencer&rsquo;s articles is new.&nbsp; Their substance has been
before us in Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s own writings for some
two-and-twenty years, in the course of which Mr. Spencer has been
followed by Professor Mivart, the Rev. J. J. Murphy, the Duke of
Argyll himself, and many other writers of less note.&nbsp; When
the Duke talks about the establishment of a scientific reign of
terror, I confess I regard such an exaggeration with something
like impatience.&nbsp; Any one who has known his own mind and has
had the courage of his opinions has been able to say whatever he
wanted to say with as little let or hindrance during the last
twenty years, as during any other period in the history of
literature.&nbsp; Of course, if a man will keep blurting out
unpopular truths without considering whose toes he may or may not
be treading on, he will make enemies some of whom will doubtless
be able to give effect to their displeasure; but that is part of
the game.&nbsp; It is hardly possible for any one to oppose the
fallacy involved in the Charles-Darwinian theory of natural
selection more persistently and unsparingly than I have done
myself from the year 1877 onwards; naturally I have at times been
very angrily attacked in consequence, and as a matter of business
have made myself as unpleasant as I could in my rejoinders, but I
cannot remember anything having been ever attempted against me
which could cause fear in any ordinarily constituted
person.&nbsp; If, then, the Duke of Argyll is right in saying
that Mr. Spencer has shown a caution almost amounting to timidity
in attacking Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, either Mr. Spencer must
be a singularly timid person, or there must be some cause for his
timidity which is not immediately obvious.&nbsp; If terror reigns
anywhere among scientific men, I should say it reigned among
those who have staked imprudently on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
reputation as a philosopher.&nbsp; I may add that the discovery
of the Duke&rsquo;s impression that there exists a scientific
reign of terror, explains a good deal in his writings which it
has not been easy to understand hitherto.</p>
<p>As regards the theory of natural selection, the Duke
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first discussions which arose on this subject,
I have ventured to maintain that . . . the phrase
&lsquo;natural-selection&rsquo; represented no true physical
cause, still less the complete set of causes requisite to account
for the orderly procession of organic forms in Nature; that in so
far as it assumed variations to arise by accident it was not only
essentially faulty and incomplete, but fundamentally erroneous;
in short, that its only value lay in the convenience with which
it groups under one form of words, highly charged with metaphor,
an immense variety of causes, some purely mental, some purely
vital, and others purely physical or mechanical.&rdquo;</p>

147</span>Chapter XI<br />
The Way of Escape</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> sum up the conclusions hitherto
arrived at.&nbsp; Our philosophers have made the mistake of
forgetting that they cannot carry the rough-and-ready language of
common sense into precincts within which politeness and
philosophy are supreme.&nbsp; Common sense sees life and death as
distinct states having nothing in common, and hence in all
respects the antitheses of one another; so that with common sense
there should be no degrees of livingness, but if a thing is alive
at all it is as much alive as the most living of us, and if dead
at all it is stone dead in every part of it.&nbsp; Our
philosophers have exercised too little consideration in retaining
this view of the matter.&nbsp; They say that an am&oelig;ba is as
much a living being as a man is, and do not allow that a
well-grown, highly educated man in robust health is more living
than an idiot cripple.&nbsp; They say he differs from the cripple
in many important respects, but not in degree of
livingness.&nbsp; Yet, as we have seen already, even common sense
by using the word &ldquo;dying&rdquo; admits degrees of life;
that is to say, it admits a more and a less; those, then, for
whom the superficial aspects of things are insufficient should
surely find no difficulty in admitting that the degrees are more
numerous than is dreamed of in the somewhat limited philosophy
which common sense alone knows.&nbsp; Livingness depends on range
of power, versatility, wealth of body and mind&mdash;how often,
indeed, do we not see people taking a new lease of life when they
have come into money even at an advanced age; it varies as these
vary, beginning with things that, though they have mind enough
for an outsider to swear by, can hardly be said to have yet found
it out themselves, and advancing to those that know their own
minds as fully as anything in this world does so.&nbsp; The more
a thing knows its own mind the more living it becomes, for life
viewed both in the individual and in the general as the outcome
of accumulated developments, is one long process of specialising
consciousness and sensation; that is to say, of getting to know
one&rsquo;s own mind more and more fully upon a greater and
greater variety of subjects.&nbsp; On this I hope to touch more
fully in another book; in the meantime I would repeat that the
error of our philosophers consists in not having borne in mind
that when they quitted the ground on which common sense can claim
authority, they should have reconsidered everything that common
sense had taught them.</p>
<p>The votaries of common sense make the same mistake as
philosophers do, but they make it in another way.&nbsp;
Philosophers try to make the language of common sense serve for
purposes of philosophy, forgetting that they are in another
world, in which another tongue is current; common sense people,
on the other hand, every now and then attempt to deal with
matters alien to the routine of daily life.&nbsp; The boundaries
between the two kingdoms being very badly defined, it is only by
giving them a wide berth and being so philosophical as almost to
deny that there is any either life or death at all, or else so
full of common sense as to refuse to see one part of the body as
less living than another, that we can hope to steer clear of
doubt, inconsistency, and contradiction in terms in almost every
other word we utter.&nbsp; We cannot serve the God of philosophy
and the Mammon of common sense at one and the same time, and yet
it would almost seem as though the making the best that can be
made of both these worlds were the whole duty of organism.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand how the error of philosophers arose,
for, slaves of habit as we all are, we are more especially slaves
when the habit is one that has not been found troublesome.&nbsp;
There is no denying that it saves trouble to have things either
one thing or the other, and indeed for all the common purposes of
life if a thing is either alive or dead the small supplementary
residue of the opposite state should be neglected as too small to
be observable.&nbsp; If it is good to eat we have no difficulty
in knowing when it is dead enough to be eaten; if not good to
eat, but valuable for its skin, we know when it is dead enough to
be skinned with impunity; if it is a man, we know when he has
presented enough of the phenomena of death to allow of our
burying him and administering his estate; in fact, I cannot call
to mind any case in which the decision of the question whether
man or beast is alive or dead is frequently found to be
perplexing; hence we have become so accustomed to think there can
be no admixture of the two states, that we have found it almost
impossible to avoid carrying this crude view of life and death
into domains of thought in which it has no application.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt that when accuracy is required we should
see life and death not as fundamentally opposed, but as
supplementary to one another, without either&rsquo;s being ever
able to exclude the other altogether; thus we should indeed see
some things as more living than others, but we should see nothing
as either unalloyedly living or unalloyedly non-living.&nbsp; If
a thing is living, it is so living that it has one foot in the
grave already; if dead, it is dead as a thing that has already
re-entered into the womb of Nature.&nbsp; And within the residue
of life that is in the dead there is an element of death; and
within this there is an element of life, and so <i>ad
infinitum</i>&mdash;again, as reflections in two mirrors that
face one another.</p>
<p>In brief, there is nothing in life of which there are not
germs, and, so to speak, harmonics in death, and nothing in death
of which germs and harmonics may not be found in life.&nbsp; Each
emphasizes what the other passes over most lightly&mdash;each
carries to its extreme conceivable development that which in the
other is only sketched in by a faint suggestion&mdash;but neither
has any feature rigorously special to itself.&nbsp; Granted that
death is a greater new departure in an organism&rsquo;s life,
than any since that <i>congeries</i> of births and deaths to
which the name embryonic stages is commonly given, still it is a
new departure of the same essential character as any
other&mdash;that is to say, though there be much new there is
much, not to say more, old along with it.&nbsp; We shrink from it
as from any other change to the unknown, and also perhaps from an
instinctive sense that the fear of death is a <i>sine qu&acirc;
non</i> for physical and moral progress, but the fear is like all
else in life, a substantial thing which, if its foundations be
dug about, is found to rest on a superstitious basis.</p>
<p>Where, and on what principle, are the dividing lines between
living and non-living to be drawn?&nbsp; All attempts to draw
them hitherto have ended in deadlock and disaster; of this M.
Vianna De Lima, in his &ldquo;Expos&eacute; Sommaire des
Th&eacute;ories transformistes de Lamarck, Darwin, et
Haeckel,&rdquo; <a name="citation150a"></a><a
href="#footnote150a" class="citation">[150a]</a> says that all
attempts to trace <i>une ligne de d&eacute;marcation nette et
profonde entre la mati&egrave;re vivante et la mati&egrave;re
inerte</i> have broken down. <a name="citation150b"></a><a
href="#footnote150b" class="citation">[150b]</a>&nbsp; <i>Il y a
un reste de vie dans le cadavre</i>, says Diderot, <a
name="citation150c"></a><a href="#footnote150c"
class="citation">[150c]</a> speaking of the more gradual decay of
the body after an easy natural death, than after a sudden and
violent one; and so Buffon begins his first volume by saying that
&ldquo;we can descend, by almost imperceptible degrees, from the
most perfect creature to the most formless matter&mdash;from the
most highly organised matter to the most entirely inorganic
substance.&rdquo; <a name="citation150d"></a><a
href="#footnote150d" class="citation">[150d]</a></p>
<p>Is the line to be so drawn as to admit any of the non-living
within the body?&nbsp; If we answer &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then, as
we have seen, moiety after moiety is filched from us, till we
find ourselves left face to face with a tenuous quasi immaterial
vital principle or soul as animating an alien body, with which it
not only has no essential underlying community of substance, but
with which it has no conceivable point in common to render a
union between the two possible, or give the one a grip of any
kind over the other; in fact, the doctrine of disembodied
spirits, so instinctively rejected by all who need be listened
to, comes back as it would seem, with a scientific
<i>imprimatur</i>; if, on the other hand, we exclude the
non-living from the body, then what are we to do with nails that
want cutting, dying skin, or hair that is ready to fall
off?&nbsp; Are they less living than brain?&nbsp; Answer
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and degrees are admitted, which we have
already seen prove fatal; answer &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and we must
deny that one part of the body is more vital than
another&mdash;and this is refusing to go as far even as common
sense does; answer that these things are not very important, and
we quit the ground of equity and high philosophy on which we have
given ourselves such airs, and go back to common sense as unjust
judges that will hear those widows only who importune us.</p>
<p>As with the non-living so also with the living.&nbsp; Are we
to let it pass beyond the limits of the body, and allow a certain
temporary overflow of livingness to ordain as it were machines in
use?&nbsp; Then death will fare, if we once let life without the
body, as life fares if we once let death within it.&nbsp; It
becomes swallowed up in life, just as in the other case life was
swallowed up in death.&nbsp; Are we to confine it to the
body?&nbsp; If so, to the whole body, or to parts?&nbsp; And if
to parts, to what parts, and why?&nbsp; The only way out of the
difficulty is to rehabilitate contradiction in terms, and say
that everything is both alive and dead at one and the same
time&mdash;some things being much living and little dead, and
others, again, much dead and little living.&nbsp; Having done
this we have only got to settle what a thing is&mdash;when a
thing is a thing pure and simple, and when it is only a
<i>congeries</i> of things&mdash;and we shall doubtless then live
very happily and very philosophically ever afterwards.</p>
<p>But here another difficulty faces us.&nbsp; Common sense does
indeed know what is meant by a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; or &ldquo;an
individual,&rdquo; but philosophy cannot settle either of these
two points.&nbsp; Professor Mivart made the question &ldquo;What
are Living Beings?&rdquo; the subject of an article in one of our
leading magazines only a very few years ago.&nbsp; He asked, but
he did not answer.&nbsp; And so Professor Moseley was reported
(<i>Times</i>, January 16, 1885) as having said that it was
&ldquo;almost impossible&rdquo; to say what an individual
was.&nbsp; Surely if it is only &ldquo;almost&rdquo; impossible
for philosophy to determine this, Professor Moseley should have
at any rate tried to do it; if, however, he had tried and failed,
which from my own experience I should think most likely, he might
have spared his &ldquo;almost.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Almost&rdquo;
is a very dangerous word.&nbsp; I once heard a man say that an
escape he had had from drowning was &ldquo;almost&rdquo;
providential.&nbsp; The difficulty about defining an individual
arises from the fact that we may look at &ldquo;almost&rdquo;
everything from two different points of view.&nbsp; If we are in
a common-sense humour for simplifying things, treating them
broadly, and emphasizing resemblances rather than differences, we
can find excellent reasons for ignoring recognised lines of
demarcation, calling everything by a new name, and unifying up
till we have united the two most distant stars in heaven as
meeting and being linked together in the eyes and souls of men;
if we are in this humour individuality after individuality
disappears, and ere long, if we are consistent, nothing will
remain but one universal whole, one true and only atom from which
alone nothing can be cut off and thrown away on to something
else; if, on the other hand, we are in a subtle philosophically
accurate humour for straining at gnats and emphasizing
differences rather than resemblances, we can draw distinctions,
and give reasons for subdividing and subdividing, till, unless we
violate what we choose to call our consistency somewhere, we
shall find ourselves with as many names as atoms and possible
combinations and permutations of atoms.&nbsp; The lines we draw,
the moments we choose for cutting this or that off at this or
that place, and thenceforth the dubbing it by another name, are
as arbitrary as the moments chosen by a South-Eastern Railway
porter for leaving off beating doormats; in each case doubtless
there is an approximate equity, but it is of a very rough and
ready kind.</p>
<p>What else, however, can we do?&nbsp; We can only escape the
Scylla of calling everything by one name, and recognising no
individual existences of any kind, by falling into the Charybdis
of having a name for everything, or by some piece of intellectual
sharp practice like that of the shrewd but unprincipled
Ulysses.&nbsp; If we were consistent honourable gentlemen, into
Charybdis or on to Scylla we should go like lambs; every
subterfuge by the help of which we escape our difficulty is but
an arbitrary high-handed act of classification that turns a deaf
ear to everything not robust enough to hold its own; nevertheless
even the most scrupulous of philosophers pockets his consistency
at a pinch, and refuses to let the native hue of resolution be
sicklied o&rsquo;er with the pale cast of thought, nor yet fobbed
by the rusty curb of logic.&nbsp; He is right, for assuredly the
poor intellectual abuses of the time want countenancing now as
much as ever, but so far as he countenances them, he should bear
in mind that he is returning to the ground of common sense, and
should not therefore hold himself too stiffly in the matter of
logic.</p>
<p>As with life and death so with design and absence of design or
luck.&nbsp; So also with union and disunion.&nbsp; There is never
either absolute design rigorously pervading every detail, nor yet
absolute absence of design pervading any detail rigorously, so,
as between substances, there is neither absolute union and
homogeneity, not absolute disunion and heterogeneity; there is
always a little place left for repentance; that is to say, in
theory we should admit that both design and chance, however well
defined, each have an aroma, as it were, of the other.&nbsp; Who
can think of a case in which his own design&mdash;about which he
should know more than any other, and from which, indeed, all his
ideas of design are derived&mdash;was so complete that there was
no chance in any part of it?&nbsp; Who, again, can bring forward
a case even of the purest chance or good luck into which no
element of design had entered directly or indirectly at any
juncture?&nbsp; This, nevertheless, does not involve our being
unable ever to ascribe a result baldly either to luck or
cunning.&nbsp; In some cases a decided preponderance of the
action, whether seen as a whole or looked at in detail, is
recognised at once as due to design, purpose, forethought, skill,
and effort, and then we properly disregard the undesigned
element; in others the details cannot without violence be
connected with design, however much the position which rendered
the main action possible may involve design&mdash;as, for
example, there is no design in the way in which individual pieces
of coal may hit one another when shot out of a sack, but there
may be design in the sack&rsquo;s being brought to the particular
place where it is emptied; in others design may be so hard to
find that we rightly deny its existence, nevertheless in each
case there will be an element of the opposite, and the residuary
element would, if seen through a mental microscope, be found to
contain a residuary element of <i>its</i> opposite, and this
again of <i>its</i> opposite, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>, as
with mirrors standing face to face.&nbsp; This having been
explained, and it being understood that when we speak of design
in organism we do so with a mental reserve of <i>exceptis
excipiendis</i>, there should be no hesitation in holding the
various modifications of plants and animals to be in such
preponderating measure due to function, that design, which
underlies function, is the fittest idea with which to connect
them in our minds.</p>
<p>We will now proceed to inquire how Mr. Darwin came to
substitute, or try to substitute, the survival of the luckiest
fittest, for the survival of the most cunning fittest, as held by
Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck; or more briefly how he came to
substitute luck for cunning.</p>

Why Darwin&rsquo;s Variations were Accidental</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> may perhaps deny that Mr.
Darwin did this, and say he laid so much stress on use and disuse
as virtually to make function his main factor of evolution.</p>
<p>If, indeed, we confine ourselves to isolated passages, we
shall find little difficulty in making out a strong case to this
effect.&nbsp; Certainly most people believe this to be Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s doctrine, and considering how long and fully he
had the ear of the public, it is not likely they would think thus
if Mr. Darwin had willed otherwise, nor could he have induced
them to think as they do if he had not said a good deal that was
capable of the construction so commonly put upon it; but it is
hardly necessary, when addressing biologists, to insist on the
fact that Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s distinctive doctrine is the denial
of the comparative importance of function, or use and disuse, as
a purveyor of variations,&mdash;with some, but not very
considerable, exceptions, chiefly in the cases of domesticated
animals.</p>
<p>He did not, however, make his distinctive feature as distinct
as he should have done.&nbsp; Sometimes he said one thing, and
sometimes the directly opposite.&nbsp; Sometimes, for example,
the conditions of existence &ldquo;included natural
selection&rdquo; or the fact that the best adapted to their
surroundings live longest and leave most offspring; <a
name="citation156a"></a><a href="#footnote156a"
class="citation">[156a]</a> sometimes &ldquo;the principle of
natural selection&rdquo; &ldquo;fully embraced&rdquo; &ldquo;the
expression of conditions of existence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation156b"></a><a href="#footnote156b"
class="citation">[156b]</a>&nbsp; It would not be easy to find
more unsatisfactory writing than this is, nor any more clearly
indicating a mind ill at ease with itself.&nbsp; Sometimes
&ldquo;ants work <i>by inherited instincts</i> and inherited
tools;&rdquo; <a name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a> sometimes, again, it is surprising
that the case of ants working by inherited instincts has not been
brought as a demonstrative argument &ldquo;against the well-known
doctrine of <i>inherited habit</i>, as advanced by
Lamarck.&rdquo; <a name="citation157b"></a><a
href="#footnote157b" class="citation">[157b]</a>&nbsp; Sometimes
the winglessness of beetles inhabiting ocean islands is
&ldquo;mainly due to natural selection,&rdquo; <a
name="citation157c"></a><a href="#footnote157c"
class="citation">[157c]</a> and though we might be tempted to
ascribe the rudimentary condition of the wing to disuse, we are
on no account to do so&mdash;though disuse was probably to some
extent &ldquo;combined with&rdquo; natural selection; at other
times &ldquo;it is probable that disuse has been the main means
of rendering the wings of beetles living on small exposed
islands&rdquo; rudimentary. <a name="citation157d"></a><a
href="#footnote157d" class="citation">[157d]</a>&nbsp; We may
remark in passing that if disuse, as Mr. Darwin admits on this
occasion, is the main agent in rendering an organ rudimentary,
use should have been the main agent in rendering it the opposite
of rudimentary&mdash;that is to say, in bringing about its
development.&nbsp; The ostensible <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, however, of the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; is to maintain that this is not the case.</p>
<p>There is hardly an opinion on the subject of descent with
modification which does not find support in some one passage or
another of the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it were
desired to show that there is no substantial difference between
the doctrine of Erasmus Darwin and that of his grandson, it would
be easy to make out a good case for this, in spite of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s calling his grandfather&rsquo;s views
&ldquo;erroneous,&rdquo; in the historical sketch prefixed to the
later editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Passing over the passage already quoted on p. 62 of this book, in
which Mr. Darwin declares &ldquo;habit omnipotent and its effects
hereditary&rdquo;&mdash;a sentence, by the way, than which none
can be either more unfalteringly Lamarckian or less tainted with
the vices of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s later style&mdash;passing this
over as having been written some twenty years before the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo;&mdash;the last paragraph of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; itself is purely Lamarckian and
Erasmus-Darwinian.&nbsp; It declares the laws in accordance with
which organic forms assumed their present shape to
be&mdash;&ldquo;Growth with reproduction; Variability from the
indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life and
from use and disuse, &amp;c.&rdquo; <a name="citation158a"></a><a
href="#footnote158a" class="citation">[158a]</a>&nbsp; Wherein
does this differ from the confession of faith made by Erasmus
Darwin and Lamarck?&nbsp; Where are the accidental fortuitous,
spontaneous variations now?&nbsp; And if they are not found
important enough to demand mention in this peroration and
<i>stretto</i>, as it were, of the whole matter, in which special
prominence should be given to the special feature of the work,
where ought they to be made important?</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin immediately goes on: &ldquo;A ratio of existence so
high as to lead to a struggle for life, and as a consequence to
natural selection, entailing divergence of character and the
extinction of less improved forms;&rdquo; so that natural
selection turns up after all.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;in the letters that
compose it, but not in the spirit; not in the special sense up to
this time attached to it in the &ldquo;Origin of
Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; The expression as used here is one with
which Erasmus Darwin would have found little fault, for it means
not as elsewhere in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s book and on his title-page
the preservation of &ldquo;favoured&rdquo; or lucky varieties,
but the preservation of varieties that have come to be varieties
through the causes assigned in the preceding two or three lines
of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s sentence; and these are mainly functional
or Erasmus-Darwinian; for the indirect action of the conditions
of life is mainly functional, and the direct action is admitted
on all hands to be but small.</p>
<p>It now appears more plainly, as insisted upon on an earlier
page, that there is not one natural selection and one survival of
the fittest, but two, inasmuch as there are two classes of
variations from which nature (supposing no exception taken to her
personification) can select.&nbsp; The bottles have the same
labels, and they are of the same colour, but the one holds
brandy, and the other toast and water.&nbsp; Nature can, by a
figure of speech, be said to select from variations that are
mainly functional or from variations that are mainly accidental;
in the first case she will eventually get an accumulation of
variation, and widely different types will come into existence;
in the second, the variations will not occur with sufficient
steadiness for accumulation to be possible.&nbsp; In the body of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s book the variations are supposed to be mainly
due to accident, and function, though not denied all efficacy, is
declared to be the greatly subordinate factor; natural selection,
therefore, has been hitherto throughout tantamount to luck; in
the peroration the position is reversed <i>in toto</i>; the
selection is now made from variations into which luck has entered
so little that it may be neglected, the greatly preponderating
factor being function; here, then, natural selection is
tantamount to cunning.&nbsp; We are such slaves of words that,
seeing the words &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;
employed&mdash;and forgetting that the results ensuing on natural
selection will depend entirely on what it is that is selected
from, so that the gist of the matter lies in this and not in the
words &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;&mdash;it escaped us that a
change of front had been made, and a conclusion entirely alien to
the tenor of the whole book smuggled into the last paragraph as
the one which it had been written to support; the book preached
luck, the peroration cunning.</p>
<p>And there can be no doubt Mr. Darwin intended that the change
of front should escape us; for it cannot be believed that he did
not perfectly well know what he had done.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin edited
and re-edited with such minuteness of revision that it may be
said no detail escaped him provided it was small enough; it is
incredible that he should have allowed this paragraph to remain
from first to last unchanged (except for the introduction of the
words &ldquo;by the Creator,&rdquo; which are wanting in the
first edition) if they did not convey the conception he most
wished his readers to retain.&nbsp; Even if in his first edition
he had failed to see that he was abandoning in his last paragraph
all that it had been his ostensible object most especially to
support in the body of his book, he must have become aware of it
long before he revised the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; for
the last time; still he never altered it, and never put us on our
guard.</p>
<p>It was not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s manner to put his reader on his
guard; we might as well expect Mr. Gladstone to put us on our
guard about the Irish land bills.&nbsp; Caveat <i>lector</i>
seems to have been his motto.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer, in the articles
already referred to, is at pains to show that Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
opinions in later life underwent a change in the direction of
laying greater stress on functionally produced modifications, and
points out that in the sixth edition of the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; Mr. Darwin says, &ldquo;I think there can be no
doubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and
enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished them;&rdquo;
whereas in his first edition he said, &ldquo;I think there can be
<i>little</i> doubt&rdquo; of this.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer also quotes
a passage from &ldquo;The Descent of Man,&rdquo; in which Mr.
Darwin said that <i>even in the first edition</i> of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; he had attributed great effect to
function, as though in the later ones he had attributed still
more; but if there was any considerable change of position, it
should not have been left to be toilsomely collected by collation
of editions, and comparison of passages far removed from one
another in other books.&nbsp; If his mind had undergone the
modification supposed by Mr. Spencer, Mr. Darwin should have said
so in a prominent passage of some later edition of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; He should have
said&mdash;&ldquo;In my earlier editions I underrated, as now
seems probable, the effects of use and disuse as purveyors of the
slight successive modifications whose accumulation in the
ordinary course of things results in specific difference, and I
laid too much stress on the accumulation of merely accidental
variations;&rdquo; having said this, he should have summarised
the reasons that had made him change his mind, and given a list
of the most important cases in which he has seen fit to alter
what he had originally written.&nbsp; If Mr. Darwin had dealt
thus with us we should have readily condoned all the mistakes he
would have been at all likely to have made, for we should have
known him as one who was trying to help us, tidy us up, keep us
straight, and enable us to use our judgments to the best
advantage.&nbsp; The public will forgive many errors alike of
taste and judgment, where it feels that a writer persistently
desires this.</p>
<p>I can only remember a couple of sentences in the later
editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; in which Mr.
Darwin directly admits a change of opinion as regards the main
causes of organic modification.&nbsp; How shuffling the first of
these is I have already shown in &ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; p.
260, and in &ldquo;Evolution, Old and New,&rdquo; p. 359; I need
not, therefore, say more here, especially as there has been no
rejoinder to what I then said.&nbsp; Curiously enough the
sentence does not bear out Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s contention that
Mr. Darwin in his later years leaned more decidedly towards
functionally produced modifications, for it runs: <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;In the earlier editions
of this work I underrated, as now seems probable, the frequency
and importance of modifications due,&rdquo; not, as Mr. Spencer
would have us believe, to use and disuse, but &ldquo;to
spontaneous variability,&rdquo; by which can only be intended,
&ldquo;to variations in no way connected with use and
disuse,&rdquo; as not being assignable to any known cause of
general application, and referable as far as we are concerned to
accident only; so that he gives the natural survival of the
luckiest, which is indeed his distinctive feature, if it deserve
to be called a feature at all, greater prominence than
ever.&nbsp; Nevertheless there is no change in his concluding
paragraph, which still remains an embodiment of the views of
Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck.</p>
<p>The other passage is on p. 421 of the edition of 1876.&nbsp;
It stands:&mdash;&ldquo;I have now recapitulated the facts and
considerations which have thoroughly&rdquo; (why
&ldquo;thoroughly&rdquo;?) &ldquo;convinced me that species have
been modified during a long course of descent.&nbsp; This has
been effected chiefly through the natural selection of numerous,
successive, slight, favourable variations; aided in an important
manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse of parts;
and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to adaptive
structures, whether past or present, by the direct action of
external conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our
ignorance to arise spontaneously.&nbsp; It appears that I
formerly underrated the frequency and value of these latter forms
of variation as leading to permanent modifications of structure
independently of natural selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, again, it is not use and disuse which Mr. Darwin
declares himself to have undervalued, but spontaneous
variations.&nbsp; The sentence just given is one of the most
confusing I ever read even in the works of Mr Darwin.&nbsp; It is
the essence of his theory that the &ldquo;numerous successive,
slight, favourable variations,&rdquo; above referred to, should
be fortuitous, accidental, spontaneous; it is evident, moreover,
that they are intended in this passage to be accidental or
spontaneous, although neither of these words is employed,
inasmuch as use and disuse and the action of the conditions of
existence, whether direct or indirect, are mentioned specially as
separate causes which purvey only the minor part of the
variations from among which nature selects.&nbsp; The words
&ldquo;that is, in relation to adaptive forms&rdquo; should be
omitted, as surplusage that draws the reader&rsquo;s attention
from the point at issue; the sentence really amounts to
this&mdash;that modification has been effected <i>chiefly through
selection</i> in the ordinary course of nature <i>from among
spontaneous variations</i>, <i>aided in an unimportant manner by
variations which qu&acirc; us are spontaneous</i>.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, though these spontaneous variations are still so
trifling in effect that they only aid spontaneous variations in
an unimportant manner, in his earlier editions Mr. Darwin thought
them still less important than he does now.</p>
<p>This comes of tinkering.&nbsp; We do not know whether we are
on our heads or our heels.&nbsp; We catch ourselves repeating
&ldquo;important,&rdquo; &ldquo;unimportant,&rdquo;
&ldquo;unimportant,&rdquo; &ldquo;important,&rdquo; like the King
when addressing the jury in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland;&rdquo;
and yet this is the book of which Mr. Grant Allen <a
name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a> says that it is &ldquo;one of the
greatest, and most learned, the most lucid, the most logical, the
most crushing, the most conclusive, that the world has ever
seen.&nbsp; Step by step, and principle by principle, it proved
every point in its progress triumphantly before it went on to the
next.&nbsp; So vast an array of facts so thoroughly in hand had
never before been mustered and marshalled in favour of any
biological theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book and the eulogy are well
mated.</p>
<p>I see that in the paragraph following on the one just quoted,
Mr. Allen says, that &ldquo;to the world at large Darwinism and
evolution became at once synonymous terms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly
it was no fault of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s if they did not, but I will
add more on this head presently; for the moment, returning to Mr.
Darwin, it is hardly credible, but it is nevertheless true, that
Mr Darwin begins the paragraph next following on the one on which
I have just reflected so severely, with the words, &ldquo;It can
hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain in so
satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection,
the several large classes of facts above specified.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If Mr. Darwin found the large classes of facts
&ldquo;satisfactorily&rdquo; explained by the survival of the
luckiest irrespectively of the cunning which enabled them to turn
their luck to account, he must have been easily satisfied.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was in the same frame of mind as when he said <a
name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a> that &ldquo;even an imperfect answer
would be satisfactory,&rdquo; but surely this is being thankful
for small mercies.</p>
<p>On the following page Mr. Darwin says:&mdash;&ldquo;Although I
am fully&rdquo; (why &ldquo;fully&rdquo;?) &ldquo;convinced of
the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of an
abstract, I by no means expect to convince experienced
naturalists,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; I have not quoted the whole of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s sentence, but it implies that any experienced
naturalist who remained unconvinced was an old-fashioned,
prejudiced person.&nbsp; I confess that this is what I rather
feel about the experienced naturalists who differ in only too
great numbers from myself, but I did not expect to find so much
of the old Adam remaining in Mr. Darwin; I did not expect to find
him support me in the belief that naturalists are made of much
the same stuff as other people, and, if they are wise, will look
upon new theories with distrust until they find them becoming
generally accepted.&nbsp; I am not sure that Mr. Darwin is not
just a little bit flippant here.</p>
<p>Sometimes I ask myself whether it is possible that, not being
convinced, I may be an experienced naturalist after all; at other
times, when I read Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s works and those of his
eulogists, I wonder whether there is not some other Mr. Darwin,
some other &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; some other Professors
Huxley, Tyndal, and Ray Lankester, and whether in each case some
malicious fiend has not palmed off a counterfeit upon me that
differs <i>toto c&aelig;lo</i> from the original.&nbsp; I felt
exactly the same when I read Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wilhelm
Meister&rdquo;; I could not believe my eyes, which nevertheless
told me that the dull diseased trash I was so toilsomely reading
was a work which was commonly held to be one of the great
literary masterpieces of the world.&nbsp; It seemed to me that
there must be some other Goethe and some other Wilhelm
Meister.&nbsp; Indeed I find myself so depressingly out of
harmony with the prevailing not opinion only, but
spirit&mdash;if, indeed, the Huxleys, Tyndals, Miss Buckleys, Ray
Lankesters, and Romaneses express the prevailing spirit as
accurately as they appear to do&mdash;that at times I find it
difficult to believe I am not the victim of hallucination;
nevertheless I know that either every canon, whether of criticism
or honourable conduct, which I have learned to respect is an
impudent swindle, suitable for the cloister only, and having no
force or application in the outside world; or else that Mr.
Darwin and his supporters are misleading the public to the full
as much as the theologians of whom they speak at times so
disapprovingly.&nbsp; They sin, moreover, with incomparably less
excuse.&nbsp; Right as they doubtless are in much, and much as we
doubtless owe them (so we owe much also to the theologians, and
they also are right in much), they are giving way to a temper
which cannot be indulged with impunity.&nbsp; I know the great
power of academicism; I know how instinctively academicism
everywhere must range itself on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s side, and how
askance it must look on those who write as I do; but I know also
that there is a power before which even academicism must bow, and
to this power I look not unhopefully for support.</p>
<p>As regards Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s contention that Mr. Darwin
leaned more towards function as he grew older, I do not doubt
that at the end of his life Mr. Darwin believed modification to
be mainly due to function, but the passage quoted on page 62
written in 1839, coupled with the concluding paragraph of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; written in 1859, and allowed to
stand during seventeen years of revision, though so much else was
altered&mdash;these passages, when their dates and surroundings
are considered, suggest strongly that Mr. Darwin thought during
all the forty years or so thus covered exactly as his grandfather
and Lamarck had done, and indeed as all sensible people since
Buffon wrote have done if they have accepted evolution at
all.</p>
<p>Then why should he not have said so?&nbsp; What object could
he have in writing an elaborate work to support a theory which he
knew all the time to be untenable?&nbsp; The impropriety of such
a course, unless the work was, like Buffon&rsquo;s, transparently
ironical, could only be matched by its fatuousness, or indeed by
the folly of one who should assign action so motiveless to any
one out of a lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>This sounds well, but unfortunately we cannot forget that when
Mr. Darwin wrote the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; he claimed
to be the originator of the theory of descent with modification
generally; that he did this without one word of reference either
to Buffon or Erasmus Darwin until the first six thousand copies
of his book had been sold, and then with as meagre, inadequate
notice as can be well conceived.&nbsp; Lamarck was just named in
the first editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; but
only to be told that Mr. Darwin had not got anything to give him,
and he must go away; the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges of
Creation&rdquo; was also just mentioned, but only in a sentence
full of such gross misrepresentation that Mr. Darwin did not
venture to stand by it, and expunged it in later editions, as
usual, without calling attention to what he had done.&nbsp; It
would have been in the highest degree imprudent, not to say
impossible, for one so conscientious as Mr. Darwin to have taken
the line he took in respect of descent with modification
generally, if he were not provided with some ostensibly
distinctive feature, in virtue of which, if people said anything,
he might claim to have advanced something different, and widely
different, from the theory of evolution propounded by his
illustrious predecessors; a distinctive theory of some sort,
therefore, had got to be looked for&mdash;and if people look in
this spirit they can generally find.</p>
<p>I imagine that Mr. Darwin, casting about for a substantial
difference, and being unable to find one, committed the
Gladstonian blunder of mistaking an unsubstantial for a
substantial one.&nbsp; It was doubtless because he suspected it
that he never took us fully into his confidence, nor in all
probability allowed even to himself how deeply he distrusted
it.&nbsp; Much, however, as he disliked the accumulation of
accidental variations, he disliked not claiming the theory of
descent with modification still more; and if he was to claim
this, accidental his variations had got to be.&nbsp; Accidental
they accordingly were, but in as obscure and perfunctory a
fashion as Mr. Darwin could make them consistently with their
being to hand as accidental variations should later developments
make this convenient.&nbsp; Under these circumstances it was
hardly to be expected that Mr. Darwin should help the reader to
follow the workings of his mind&mdash;nor, again, that a book the
writer of which was hampered as I have supposed should prove
clear and easy reading.</p>
<p>The attitude of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind, whatever it may have
been in regard to the theory of descent with modification
generally, goes so far to explain his attitude in respect to the
theory of natural selection (which, it cannot be too often
repeated, is only one of the conditions of existence advanced as
the main means of modification by the earlier evolutionists),
that it is worth while to settle the question once for all
whether Mr. Darwin did or did not believe himself justified in
claiming the theory of descent as an original discovery of his
own.&nbsp; This will be a task of some little length, and may
perhaps try the reader&rsquo;s patience, as it assuredly tried
mine; if, however, he will read the two following chapters, he
will probably be able to make up his mind upon much that will
otherwise, if he thinks about it at all, continue to puzzle
him.</p>
<h2><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>Chapter XIII<br />
Darwin&rsquo;s Claim to Descent with Modification</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Allen</span>, in his &ldquo;Charles
Darwin,&rdquo; <a name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a> says that &ldquo;in the public mind
Mr. Darwin is commonly regarded as the discoverer and founder of
the evolution hypothesis,&rdquo; and on p. 177 he says that to
most men Darwinism and evolution mean one and the same
thing.&nbsp; Mr. Allen declares misconception on this matter to
be &ldquo;so extremely general&rdquo; as to be &ldquo;almost
universal;&rdquo; this is more true than creditable to Mr.
Darwin.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen says <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a> that though Mr.
Darwin gained &ldquo;far wider general acceptance&rdquo; for both
the doctrine of descent in general, and for that of the descent
of man from a simious or semi-simious ancestor in particular,
&ldquo;he laid no sort of claim to originality or proprietorship
in either theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is not the case.&nbsp; No one
can claim a theory more frequently and more effectually than Mr.
Darwin claimed descent with modification, nor, as I have already
said, is it likely that the misconception of which Mr. Allen
complains would be general, if he had not so claimed it.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; begins:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When on board H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>, as naturalist, I
was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the
inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relation of
the present to the past inhabitants of that continent.&nbsp;
These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of
species&mdash;that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by
one of our greatest philosophers.&nbsp; On my return home it
occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out
on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting upon
all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on
it.&nbsp; After five years&rsquo; work I allowed myself to
speculate upon the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I
enlarged in 1844 <a name="citation169a"></a><a
href="#footnote169a" class="citation">[169a]</a> into a sketch of
the conclusions which then seemed to me probable.&nbsp; From that
period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same
object.&nbsp; I hope I may be excused these personal details, as
I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a
decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is bland, but peremptory.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin implies that
the mere asking of the question how species has come about opened
up a field into which speculation itself had hardly yet ventured
to intrude.&nbsp; It was the mystery of mysteries; one of our
greatest philosophers had said so; not one little feeble ray of
light had ever yet been thrown upon it.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin knew all
this, and was appalled at the greatness of the task that lay
before him; still, after he had pondered on what he had seen in
South America, it really did occur to him, that if he was very
very patient, and went on reflecting for years and years longer,
upon all sorts of facts, good, bad, and indifferent, which could
possibly have any bearing on the subject&mdash;and what fact
might not possibly have some bearing?&mdash;well, something, as
against the nothing that had been made out hitherto, might by
some faint far-away possibility be one day dimly seem.&nbsp; It
was only what he had seen in South America that made all this
occur to him.&nbsp; He had never seen anything about descent with
modification in any book, nor heard any one talk about it as
having been put forward by other people; if he had, he would, of
course, have been the first to say so; he was not as other
philosophers are; so the mountain went on for years and years
gestating, but still there was no labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work,&rdquo; continues Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;is now
nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three years to
complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been
urged to publish this abstract.&nbsp; I have been more especially
induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the
natural history of the Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost
exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of
species.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Darwin was naturally anxious to
forestall Mr. Wallace, and hurried up with his book.&nbsp; What
reader, on finding descent with modification to be its most
prominent feature, could doubt&mdash;especially if new to the
subject, as the greater number of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s readers in
1859 were&mdash;that this same descent with modification was the
theory which Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace had jointly hit upon, and
which Mr. Darwin was so anxious to show that he had not been
hasty in adopting?&nbsp; When Mr. Darwin went on to say that his
abstract would be very imperfect, and that he could not give
references and authorities for his several statements, we did not
suppose that such an apology could be meant to cover silence
concerning writers who during their whole lives, or nearly so,
had borne the burden and heat of the day in respect of descent
with modification in its most extended application.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I much regret,&rdquo; says Mr. Darwin, &ldquo;that want of
space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the
generous assistance I have received from very many naturalists,
some of them personally unknown to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is like
what the Royal Academicians say when they do not intend to hang
our pictures; they can, however, generally find space for a
picture if they want to hang it, and we assume with safety that
there are no master-works by painters of the very highest rank
for which no space has been available.&nbsp; Want of space will,
indeed, prevent my quoting from more than one other paragraph of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s introduction; this paragraph, however, should
alone suffice to show how inaccurate Mr. Allen is in saying that
Mr. Darwin &ldquo;laid no sort of claim to originality or
proprietorship&rdquo; in the theory of descent with modification,
and this is the point with which we are immediately
concerned.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In considering the origin of species, it is quite
conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual
affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations,
their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other
such facts, might come to the conclusion that each species had
not been independently created, but had descended like varieties
from other species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed that not only is no hint given here that
descent with modification was a theory which, though unknown to
the general public, had been occupying the attention of
biologists for a hundred years and more, but it is distinctly
implied that this was not the case.&nbsp; When Mr. Darwin said it
was &ldquo;conceivable that a naturalist might&rdquo; arrive at
the theory of descent, straightforward readers took him to mean
that though this was conceivable, it had never, to Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s knowledge, been done.&nbsp; If we had a notion
that we had already vaguely heard of the theory that men and the
lower animals were descended from common ancestors, we must have
been wrong; it was not this that we had heard of, but something
else, which, though doubtless a little like it, was all wrong,
whereas this was obviously going to be all right.</p>
<p>To follow the rest of the paragraph with the closeness that it
merits would be a task at once so long and so unpleasant that I
will omit further reference to any part of it except the last
sentence.&nbsp; That sentence runs:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the case of the mistletoe, which draws its
nourishment from certain trees, which has seeds that must be
transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate
sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring
pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous
to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations
to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of the
external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless it would be preposterous to refer the structure of
either woodpecker or mistletoe to the single agency of any one of
these three causes; but neither Lamarck nor any other writer on
evolution has, so far as I know, even contemplated this; the
early evolutionists supposed organic modification to depend on
the action and interaction of all three, and I venture to think
that this will ere long be considered as, to say the least of it,
not more preposterous than the assigning of the largely
preponderating share in the production of such highly and
variously correlated organisms as the mistletoe and woodpecker
mainly to luck pure and simple, as is done by Mr. Charles
Darwin&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>It will be observed that in the paragraph last quoted from,
Mr. Darwin, <i>more suo</i>, is careful not to commit
himself.&nbsp; All he has said is, that it would be preposterous
to do something the preposterousness of which cannot be
reasonably disputed; the impression, however, is none the less
effectually conveyed, that some one of the three assigned
agencies, taken singly, was the only cause of modification ever
yet proposed, if, indeed, any writer had even gone so far as
this.&nbsp; We knew we did not know much about the matter
ourselves, and that Mr. Darwin was a naturalist of long and high
standing; we naturally, therefore, credited him with the same
good faith as a writer that we knew in ourselves as readers; it
never so much as crossed our minds to suppose that the head which
he was holding up all dripping before our eyes as that of a fool,
was not that of a fool who had actually lived and written, but
only of a figure of straw which had been dipped in a bucket of
red paint.&nbsp; Naturally enough we concluded, since Mr. Darwin
seemed to say so, that if his predecessors had nothing better to
say for themselves than this, it would not be worth while to
trouble about them further; especially as we did not know who
they were, nor what they had written, and Mr. Darwin did not tell
us.&nbsp; It would be better and less trouble to take the goods
with which it was plain Mr. Darwin was going to provide us, and
ask no questions.&nbsp; We have seen that even tolerably obvious
conclusions were rather slow in occurring to poor simple-minded
Mr. Darwin, and may be sure that it never once occurred to him
that the British public would be likely to argue thus; he had no
intention of playing the scientific confidence trick upon
us.&nbsp; I dare say not, but unfortunately the result has
closely resembled the one that would have ensued if Mr. Darwin
had had such an intention.</p>
<p>The claim to originality made so distinctly in the opening
sentences of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; is repeated in a
letter to Professor Haeckel, written October 8, 1864, and giving
an account of the development of his belief in descent with
modification.&nbsp; This letter, part of which is quoted by Mr.
Allen, <a name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a> is given on p. 134 of the English
translation of Professor Haeckel&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Creation,&rdquo; <a name="citation173b"></a><a
href="#footnote173b" class="citation">[173b]</a> and runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In South America three classes of facts were brought
strongly before my mind.&nbsp; Firstly, the manner in which
closely allied species replace species in going southward.&nbsp;
Secondly, the close affinity of the species inhabiting the
islands near South America to those proper to the
continent.&nbsp; This struck me profoundly, especially the
difference of the species in the adjoining islets in the
Galapagos Archipelago.&nbsp; Thirdly, the relation of the living
Edentata and Rodentia to the extinct species.&nbsp; I shall never
forget my astonishment when I dug out a gigantic piece of armour
like that of the living armadillo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reflecting on these facts, and collecting analogous
ones, it seemed to me probable that allied species were descended
from a common ancestor.&nbsp; But during several years I could
not conceive how each form could have been modified so as to
become admirably adapted to its place in nature.&nbsp; I began,
therefore, to study domesticated animals and cultivated plants,
and after a time perceived that man&rsquo;s power of selecting
and breeding from certain individuals was the most powerful of
all means in the production of new races.&nbsp; Having attended
to the habits of animals and their relations to the surrounding
conditions, I was able to realise the severe struggle for
existence to which all organisms are subjected, and my geological
observations had allowed me to appreciate to a certain extent the
duration of past geological periods.&nbsp; Therefore, when I
happened to read Malthus on population, the idea of natural
selection flashed on me.&nbsp; Of all minor points, the last
which I appreciated was the importance and cause of the principle
of divergence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is all very na&iuml;ve, and accords perfectly with the
introductory paragraphs of the &ldquo;Origin of Species;&rdquo;
it gives us the same picture of a solitary thinker, a poor,
lonely, friendless student of nature, who had never so much as
heard of Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, or Lamarck.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
however, we cannot forget the description of the influences
which, according to Mr. Grant Allen, did in reality surround Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s youth, and certainly they are more what we should
have expected than those suggested rather than expressly stated
by Mr. Darwin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everywhere around him,&rdquo; says
Mr. Allen, <a name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a> &ldquo;in his childhood and youth
these great but formless&rdquo; (why &ldquo;formless&rdquo;?)
&ldquo;evolutionary ideas were brewing and fermenting.&nbsp; The
scientific society of his elders and of the contemporaries among
whom he grew up was permeated with the leaven of Laplace and
Lamarck, of Hutton and of Herschel.&nbsp; Inquiry was especially
everywhere rife as to the origin and nature of specific
distinctions among plants and animals.&nbsp; Those who believed
in the doctrine of Buffon and of the &lsquo;Zoonomia,&rsquo; and
those who disbelieved in it, alike, were profoundly interested
and agitated in soul by the far-reaching implications of that
fundamental problem.&nbsp; On every side evolutionism, in its
crude form.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I suppose Mr. Allen could not help
saying &ldquo;in its crude form,&rdquo; but descent with
modification in 1809 meant, to all intents and purposes, and was
understood to mean, what it means now, or ought to mean, to most
people.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The universal stir,&rdquo; says Mr. Allen
on the following page, &ldquo;and deep prying into evolutionary
questions which everywhere existed among scientific men in his
early days was naturally communicated to a lad born of a
scientific family and inheriting directly in blood and bone the
biological tastes and tendencies of Erasmus Darwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess to thinking that Mr. Allen&rsquo;s account of the
influences which surrounded Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s youth, if tainted
with picturesqueness, is still substantially correct.&nbsp; On an
earlier page he had written:&mdash;&ldquo;It is impossible to
take up any scientific memoirs or treatises of the first half of
our own century without seeing at a glance how every mind of high
original scientific importance was permeated and disturbed by the
fundamental questions aroused, but not fully answered, by Buffon,
Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin.&nbsp; In Lyell&rsquo;s letters, and
in Agassiz&rsquo;s lectures, in the &lsquo;Botanic Journal&rsquo;
and in the &lsquo;Philosophical Transactions,&rsquo; in treatises
on Madeira beetles and the Australian flora, we find everywhere
the thoughts of men profoundly influenced in a thousand
directions by this universal evolutionary solvent and leaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while the world of thought was thus seething and
moving restlessly before the wave of ideas set in motion by these
various independent philosophers, another group of causes in
another field was rendering smooth the path beforehand for the
future champion of the amended evolutionism.&nbsp; Geology on the
one hand and astronomy on the other were making men&rsquo;s minds
gradually familiar with the conception of slow natural
development, as opposed to immediate and miraculous creation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">. . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The influence of these novel conceptions upon the
growth and spread of evolutionary ideas was far-reaching and
twofold.&nbsp; In the first place, the discovery of a definite
succession of nearly related organic forms following one another
with evident closeness through the various ages, inevitably
suggested to every inquiring observer the possibility of their
direct descent one from the other.&nbsp; In the second place, the
discovery that geological formations were not really separated
each from its predecessor by violent revolutions, but were the
result of gradual and ordinary changes, discredited the old idea
of frequent fresh creations after each catastrophe, and
familiarised the minds of men of science with the alternative
notion of slow and natural evolutionary processes.&nbsp; The past
was seen in effect to be the parent of the present; the present
was recognised as the child of the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is certainly not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own account of the
matter.&nbsp; Probably the truth will lie somewhere between the
two extreme views: and on the one hand, the world of thought was
not seething quite so badly as Mr. Allen represents it, while on
the other, though &ldquo;three classes of fact,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
were undoubtedly &ldquo;brought strongly before&rdquo; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;mind in South America,&rdquo; yet some of
them had perhaps already been brought before it at an earlier
time, which he did not happen to remember at the moment of
writing his letter to Professor Haeckel and the opening paragraph
of the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;</p>

Darwin and Descent with Modification (<i>continued</i>)</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> said enough to show that Mr.
Darwin claimed I to have been the originator of the theory of
descent with modification as distinctly as any writer usually
claims any theory; but it will probably save the reader trouble
in the end if I bring together a good many, though not, probably,
all (for I much disliked the task, and discharged it
perfunctorily), of the passages in the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; in which the theory of descent with modification
in its widest sense is claimed expressly or by implication.&nbsp;
I shall quote from the original edition, which, it should be
remembered, consisted of the very unusually large number of four
thousand copies, and from which no important deviation was made
either by addition or otherwise until a second edition of two
thousand further copies had been sold; the &ldquo;Historical
Sketch,&rdquo; &amp;c., being first given with the third
edition.&nbsp; The italics, which I have employed so as to catch
the reader&rsquo;s eye, are mine, not Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although much remains obscure, and will long remain
obscure, <i>I can entertain no doubt</i>, <i>after the most
deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am
capable</i>, <i>that the view which most naturalists
entertain</i>, <i>and which I formerly entertained&mdash;namely
that each species has been independently created&mdash;is
erroneous</i>.&nbsp; I am fully convinced that species are not
immutable, but that those belonging to what are called the same
genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct
species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any
one species are the descendants of that species.&nbsp;
Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection&rdquo; (or the
preservation of fortunate races) &ldquo;has been the main but not
exclusive means of modification&rdquo; (p. 6).</p>
<p>It is not here expressly stated that the theory of the
mutability of species is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own; this,
nevertheless, is the inference which the great majority of his
readers were likely to draw, and did draw, from Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that all large genera are now varying much,
and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that
no small genera are now multiplying and increasing; for if this
had been so it would have been fatal to <i>my theory</i>;
inasmuch as geology,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 56).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; stand in all the
editions.&nbsp; Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This relation has a clear meaning <i>on my view</i> of
the subject; I look upon all the species of any genus as having
as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two
sexes of any one of the species&rdquo; (p. 157).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My view&rdquo; here, especially in the absence of
reference to any other writer as having held the same opinion,
implies as its most natural interpretation that descent pure and
simple is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s view.&nbsp; Substitute &ldquo;the
theory of descent&rdquo; for &ldquo;my view,&rdquo; and we do not
feel that we are misinterpreting the author&rsquo;s
meaning.&nbsp; The words &ldquo;my view&rdquo; remain in all
editions.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long before having arrived at this part of my work, a
crowd of difficulties will have occurred to the reader.&nbsp;
Some of them are so grave that to this day I can never reflect on
them without being staggered; but to the best of my belief the
greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are
not, I think, <i>fatal to my theory</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These difficulties and objections may be classed under
the following heads:&mdash;Firstly, if species have descended
from other species by insensibly fine gradations, why do we not
everywhere see?&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 171).</p>
<p>We infer from this that &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; is the theory
&ldquo;that species have descended from other species by
insensibly fine gradations&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, that it
is the theory of descent with modification; for the theory that
is being objected to is obviously the theory of descent <i>in
toto</i>, and not a mere detail in connection with that
theory.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; were altered in 1872, with
the sixth edition of the &ldquo;Origin of species,&rdquo; into
&ldquo;the theory;&rdquo; but I am chiefly concerned with the
first edition of the work, my object being to show that Mr.
Darwin was led into his false position as regards natural
selection by a desire to claim the theory of descent with
modification; if he claimed it in the first edition, this is
enough to give colour to the view which I take; but it must be
remembered that descent with modification remained, by the
passage just quoted &ldquo;my theory,&rdquo; for thirteen years,
and even when in 1869 and 1872, for a reason that I can only
guess at, &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; became generally &ldquo;the
theory,&rdquo; this did not make it become any one else&rsquo;s
theory.&nbsp; It is hard to say whose or what it became, if the
words are to be construed technically; practically, however, with
all ingenuous readers, &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; remained as much
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory as though the words &ldquo;my
theory&rdquo; had been retained, and Mr. Darwin cannot be
supposed so simple-minded as not to have known this would be the
case.&nbsp; Moreover, it appears, from the next page but one to
the one last quoted, that Mr. Darwin claimed the theory of
descent with modification generally, even to the last, for we
there read, &ldquo;<i>By my theory</i> these allied species have
descended from a common parent,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;my&rdquo;
has been allowed, for some reason not quite obvious, to survive
the general massacre of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;my&rsquo;s&rdquo; which occurred in 1869 and 1872.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who believes that each being has been created as we
now see it, must occasionally have felt surprise when he has
met,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 185).</p>
<p>Here the argument evidently lies between descent and
independent acts of creation.&nbsp; This appears from the
paragraph immediately following, which begins, &ldquo;He who
believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; We therefore understand descent to be the theory so
frequently spoken of by Mr. Darwin as &ldquo;my.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this
treatise that large bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can
be explained <i>by the theory of descent</i>, ought not to
hesitate to go farther, and to admit that a structure even as
perfect as an eagle&rsquo;s eye might be formed <i>by natural
selection</i>, although in this case he does not know any of the
transitional grades&rdquo; (p. 188).</p>
<p>The natural inference from this is that descent and natural
selection are one and the same thing.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ
existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous,
successive, slight modifications, <i>my theory</i> would
absolutely break down.&nbsp; But I can find out no such
case.&nbsp; No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know
the transitional grades, more especially if we look to
much-isolated species, round which, according to my
<i>theory</i>, there has been much extinction&rdquo; (p.
189).</p>
<p>This makes &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; to be &ldquo;the theory
that complex organs have arisen by numerous, successive, slight
modifications;&rdquo; that is to say, to be the theory of descent
with modification.&nbsp; The first of the two &ldquo;my
theory&rsquo;s&rdquo; in the passage last quoted has been allowed
to stand.&nbsp; The second became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1872.&nbsp; It is obvious, therefore, that &ldquo;the
theory&rdquo; means &ldquo;my theory;&rdquo; it is not so obvious
why the change should have been made at all, nor why the one
&ldquo;my theory&rdquo; should have been taken and the other
left, but I will return to this question.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. Darwin writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding
that any organ could not possibly have been produced by small
successive transitional gradations, yet, undoubtedly grave cases
of difficulty occur, some of which will be discussed in my future
work&rdquo; (p. 192).</p>
<p>This, as usual, implies descent with modification to be the
theory that Mr. Darwin is trying to make good.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named
towards which no transitional variety is known to lead . . . Why,
<i>on the theory of creation</i>, should this be so?&nbsp; Why
should not nature have taken a leap from structure to
structure?&nbsp; <i>On the theory of natural selection</i> we can
clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection can
act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she
can never take a leap, but must advance by the slowest and
shortest steps&rdquo; (p. 194).</p>
<p>Here &ldquo;the theory of natural selection&rdquo; is opposed
to &ldquo;the theory of creation;&rdquo; we took it, therefore,
to be another way of saying &ldquo;the theory of descent with
modification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have in this chapter discussed some of the
difficulties and objections which may be urged against <i>my
theory</i>.&nbsp; Many of them are very grave, but I think that
in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts which,
<i>on the theory of independent acts of creation</i>, are utterly
obscure&rdquo; (p. 203).</p>
<p>Here we have, on the one hand, &ldquo;my theory,&rdquo; on the
other, &ldquo;independent acts of creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
natural antithesis to independent acts of creation is descent,
and we assumed with reason that Mr. Darwin was claiming this when
he spoke of &ldquo;my theory.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the theory of natural selection we can clearly
understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history,
&lsquo;<i>Natura non facit saltum</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; This canon,
if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world is not
strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it
must <i>by my theory</i> be strictly true&rdquo; (p. 206).</p>
<p>Here the natural interpretation of &ldquo;by my theory&rdquo;
is &ldquo;by the theory of descent with modification;&rdquo; the
words &ldquo;on the theory of natural selection,&rdquo; with
which the sentence opens, lead us to suppose that Mr. Darwin
regarded natural selection and descent as convertible
terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;My theory&rdquo; was altered to &ldquo;this
theory&rdquo; in 1872.&nbsp; Six lines lower down we read,
&ldquo;<i>On my theory</i> unity of type is explained by unity of
descent.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;my&rdquo; here has been allowed
to stand.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, as in the case of corporeal structure, and
conformably with <i>my theory</i>, the instinct of each species
is good for itself, but has never,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 210).</p>
<p>Who was to see that &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; did not include
descent with modification?&nbsp; The &ldquo;my&rdquo; here has
been allowed to stand.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that instincts . . . are liable to make
mistakes;&mdash;that no instinct has been produced for the
exclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes
advantage of the instincts of others;&mdash;that the canon of
natural history, &lsquo;<i>Natura non facit saltum</i>,&rsquo; is
applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is
plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise
inexplicable,&mdash;<i>all tend to corroborate the theory of
natural selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 243).</p>
<p>We feel that it is the theory of evolution, or descent with
modification, that is here corroborated, and that it is this
which Mr. Darwin is mainly trying to establish; the sentence
should have ended &ldquo;all tend to corroborate the theory of
descent with modification;&rdquo; the substitution of
&ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; for descent tends to make us
think that these conceptions are identical.&nbsp; That they are
so regarded, or at any rate that it is the theory of descent in
full which Mr. Darwin has in his mind, appears from the
immediately succeeding paragraph, which begins &ldquo;<i>This
theory</i>,&rdquo; and continues six lines lower, &ldquo;For
instance, we can understand, on the <i>principle of
inheritance</i>, how it is that,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, it should always be borne in mind
what sort of intermediate forms must, <i>on my theory</i>,
formerly have existed&rdquo; (p. 280).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1869.&nbsp; No reader who read in good faith could doubt that the
theory of descent with modification was being here intended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just possible <i>by my theory</i>, that one of
two living forms might have descended from the other; for
instance, a horse from a tapir; but in this case <i>direct</i>
intermediate links will have existed between them&rdquo; (p.
281).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>By the theory of natural selection</i> all living
species have been connected with the parent species of each
genus,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; We took this to mean, &ldquo;By the
theory of descent with modification all living species,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (p. 281).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of
the very fine species of D&rsquo;Orbigny and others into the rank
of varieties; and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of
change which <i>on my theory</i> we ought to find&rdquo; (p.
297).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>In the fourth edition (1866), in a passage which is not in
either of the two first editions, we read (p. 359), &ldquo;So
that here again we have undoubted evidence of change in the
direction required by <i>my theory</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in 1869; the theory
of descent with modification is unquestionably intended.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geological research has done scarcely anything in
breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting them
together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not
having been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of
all the many objections which may be urged against <i>my
views</i>&rdquo; (p. 299).</p>
<p>We naturally took &ldquo;my views&rdquo; to mean descent with
modification.&nbsp; The &ldquo;my&rdquo; has been allowed to
stand.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, then, there be some degree of truth in these
remarks, we have no right to expect to find in our geological
formations an infinite number of those transitional forms which
<i>on my theory</i> assuredly have connected all the past and
present species of the same group in one long and branching chain
of life . . . But I do not pretend that I should ever have
suspected how poor was the record in the best preserved
geological sections, had not the absence of innumerable
transitional links between the species which lived at the
commencement and at the close of each formation pressed so hardly
<i>on my theory</i>&rdquo; (pp. 301, 302).</p>
<p>Substitute &ldquo;descent with modification&rdquo; for
&ldquo;my theory&rdquo; and the meaning does not suffer.&nbsp;
The first of the two &ldquo;my theories&rdquo; in the passage
last quoted was altered in 1869 into &ldquo;our theory;&rdquo;
the second has been allowed to stand.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species
suddenly appear in some formations, has been urged by several
pal&aelig;ontologists . . . as a fatal objection <i>to the belief
in the transmutation of species</i>.&nbsp; If numerous species,
belonging to the same genera or families, have really started
into life all at once, the fact would be fatal <i>to the theory
of descent with slow modification through natural
selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 302).</p>
<p>Here &ldquo;the belief in the transmutation of species,&rdquo;
or descent with modification, is treated as synonymous with
&ldquo;the theory of descent with slow modification through
natural selection;&rdquo; but it has nowhere been explained that
there are two widely different &ldquo;theories of descent with
slow modification through natural selection,&rdquo; the one of
which may be true enough for all practical purposes, while the
other is seen to be absurd as soon as it is examined
closely.&nbsp; The theory of descent with modification is not
properly convertible with either of these two views, for descent
with modification deals with the question whether species are
transmutable or no, and dispute as to the respective merits of
the two natural selections deals with the question how it comes
to be transmuted; nevertheless, the words &ldquo;the theory of
descent with slow modification through the ordinary course of
things&rdquo; (which is what &ldquo;descent with modification
through natural selection&rdquo; comes to) may be considered as
expressing the facts with practical accuracy, if the ordinary
course of nature is supposed to be that modification is mainly
consequent on the discharge of some correlated function, and that
modification, if favourable, will tend to accumulate so long as
the given function continues important to the wellbeing of the
organism; the words, however, have no correspondence with reality
if they are supposed to imply that variations which are mainly
matters of pure chance and unconnected in any way with function
will accumulate and result in specific difference, no matter how
much each one of them may be preserved in the generation in which
it appears.&nbsp; In the one case, therefore, the expression
natural selection may be loosely used as a synonym for descent
with modification, and in the other it may not.&nbsp;
Unfortunately with Mr. Charles Darwin the variations are mainly
accidental.&nbsp; The words &ldquo;through natural
selection,&rdquo; therefore, in the passage last quoted carry no
weight, for it is the wrong natural selection that is, or ought
to be, intended; practically, however, they derived a weight from
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s name to which they had no title of their own,
and we understood that &ldquo;the theory of descent with slow
modification&rdquo; through the kind of natural selection
ostensibly intended by Mr. Darwin was a quasi-synonymous
expression for the transmutation of species.&nbsp; We
understood&mdash;so far as we understood anything beyond that we
were to believe in descent with modification&mdash;that natural
selection was Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory; we therefore concluded,
since Mr. Darwin seemed to say so, that the theory of the
transmutation of species generally was so also.&nbsp; At any rate
we felt as regards the passage last quoted that the theory of
descent with modification was the point of attack and defence,
and we supposed it to be the theory so often referred to by Mr.
Darwin as &ldquo;my.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the most ancient Silurian animals, as the
Nautilus, Lingula, &amp;c., do not differ much from the living
species; and it cannot <i>on my theory</i> be supposed that these
old species were the progenitors,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 306) . . .
&ldquo;Consequently <i>if my theory be true</i>, it is
indisputable,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 307).</p>
<p>Here the two &ldquo;my theories&rdquo; have been altered, the
first into &ldquo;our theory,&rdquo; and the second into
&ldquo;the theory,&rdquo; both in 1869; but, as usual, the thing
that remains with the reader is the theory of descent, and it
remains morally and practically as much claimed when called
&ldquo;the theory&rdquo;&mdash;as during the many years
throughout which the more open &ldquo;my&rdquo; distinctly
claimed it.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the most eminent pal&aelig;ontologists, namely,
Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, E. Forbes, &amp;c., and all our
greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, &amp;c., have
unanimously, often vehemently, maintained <i>the immutability of
species</i>. . . . I feel how rash it is to differ from these
great authorities . . . Those who think the natural geological
record in any degree perfect, and who do not attach much weight
to the facts and arguments of other kinds brought forward in this
volume, will undoubtedly at once <i>reject my theory</i>&rdquo;
(p. 310).</p>
<p>What is &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; here, if not that of the
mutability of species, or the theory of descent with
modification?&nbsp; &ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the
theory&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now see whether the several facts and rules
relating to the geological succession of organic beings, better
accord with the common view of the immutability of species, or
with that of their <i>slow and gradual modification</i>,
<i>through descent and natural selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 312).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; are indeed here, but
they might as well be omitted for all the effect they
produce.&nbsp; The argument is felt to be about the two opposed
theories of descent, and independent creative efforts.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These several facts accord well with <i>my
theory</i>&rdquo; (p. 314).&nbsp; That &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; is
the theory of descent is the conclusion most naturally drawn from
the context.&nbsp; &ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;our
theory&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gradual increase in the number of the species of a
group is strictly conformable <i>with my theory</i>; for the
process of modification and the production of a number of allied
forms must be slow and gradual, . . . like the branching of a
great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes
large&rdquo; (p. 314).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1869.&nbsp; We took &ldquo;my theory&rdquo; to be the theory of
descent; that Mr. Darwin treats this as synonymous with the
theory of natural selection appears from the next paragraph, on
the third line of which we read, &ldquo;On <i>the theory of
natural selection</i> the extinction of old forms,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The theory of natural selection</i> is grounded on
the belief that each new variety and ultimately each new species,
is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those
with which it comes into competition; and the consequent
extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably
follows&rdquo; (p. 320).&nbsp; Sense and consistency cannot be
made of this passage.&nbsp; Substitute &ldquo;The theory of the
preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life&rdquo;
for &ldquo;The theory of natural selection&rdquo; (to do this is
only taking Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s own synonym for natural selection)
and see what the passage comes to.&nbsp; &ldquo;The preservation
of favoured races&rdquo; is not a theory, it is a commonly
observed fact; it is not &ldquo;grounded on the belief that each
new variety,&rdquo; &amp;c., it is one of the ultimate and most
elementary principles in the world of life.&nbsp; When we try to
take the passage seriously and think it out, we soon give it up,
and pass on, substituting &ldquo;the theory of descent&rdquo; for
&ldquo;the theory of natural selection,&rdquo; and concluding
that in some way these two things must be identical.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manner in which single species and whole groups of
species become extinct accords well with <i>the theory of natural
selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 322).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms
of life throughout the world, is explicable <i>on the theory of
natural selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 325).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and
living species.&nbsp; They all fall into one grand natural
system; and this is at once explained <i>on the principle of
descent</i>&rdquo; (p. 329).</p>
<p>Putting the three preceding passages together, we naturally
inferred that &ldquo;the theory of natural selection&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the principle of descent&rdquo; were the same
things.&nbsp; We knew Mr. Darwin claimed the first, and therefore
unhesitatingly gave him the second at the same time.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see how far these several facts and inferences
accord with <i>the theory of descent with modification</i>&rdquo;
(p. 331)</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, <i>on the theory of descent with
modification</i>, the main facts with regard to the mutual
affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to
living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory
manner.&nbsp; And they are wholly inexplicable <i>on any other
view</i>&rdquo; (p. 333).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;seem to me&rdquo; involve a claim in the
absence of so much as a hint in any part of the book concerning
indebtedness to earlier writers.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the theory of descent</i>, the full meaning of
the fossil remains,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 336).</p>
<p>In the following paragraph we read:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in one particular sense the more recent forms must,
<i>on my theory</i>, be higher than the more ancient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a
certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes;
or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some
degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms.
. . . This doctrine of Agassiz accords well with <i>the theory of
natural selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 338).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory of natural selection&rdquo; became
&ldquo;our theory&rdquo; in 1869.&nbsp; The opinion of Agassiz
accords excellently with the theory of descent with modification,
but it is not easy to see how it bears upon the fact that lucky
races are preserved in the struggle for life&mdash;which,
according to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s title-page, is what is meant by
natural selection.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the theory of descent with modification</i>, the
great law of the long-enduring but not immutable succession of
the same types within the same areas, is at once explained&rdquo;
(p. 340).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must not be forgotten that, <i>on my theory</i>, all
the species of the same genus have descended from some one
species&rdquo; (p. 341).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;our theory&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who rejects these views on the nature of the
geological record, will rightly reject <i>my whole
theory</i>&rdquo; (p. 342).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&rdquo; became &ldquo;our&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing from these difficulties, the other great
leading facts in pal&aelig;ontology agree admirably with <i>the
theory of descent with modification through variation and natural
selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 343).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>The succession of the same types of structure within the same
areas during the later geological periods <i>ceases to be
mysterious</i>, and <i>is simply explained by inheritance</i> (p.
345).</p>
<p>I suppose inheritance was not when Mr. Darwin wrote considered
mysterious.&nbsp; The last few words have been altered to
&ldquo;and is intelligible on the principle of
inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems as though Mr. Darwin did not
like saying that inheritance was not mysterious, but had no
objection to implying that it was intelligible.</p>
<p>The next paragraph begins&mdash;&ldquo;If, then, the
geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be, . . .
the main objections <i>to the theory of natural selection</i> are
greatly diminished or disappear.&nbsp; On the other hand, all the
chief laws of pal&aelig;ontology plainly proclaim, <i>as it seems
to me</i>, <i>that species have been produced by ordinary
generation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again the claim to the theory of descent with
modification is unmistakable; it cannot, moreover, but occur to
us that if species &ldquo;have been produced by ordinary
generation,&rdquo; then ordinary generation has as good a claim
to be the main means of originating species as natural selection
has.&nbsp; It is hardly necessary to point out that ordinary
generation involves descent with modification, for all known
offspring differ from their parents, so far, at any rate, as that
practised judges can generally tell them apart.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see in these facts some deep organic bond,
prevailing throughout space and time, over the same areas of land
and water, and independent of their physical condition.&nbsp; The
naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not led to inquire
what this bond is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This bond, <i>on my theory</i>, <i>is simply
inheritance</i>, that cause which alone,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p.
350).</p>
<p>This passage was altered in 1869 to &ldquo;The bond is simply
inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paragraph concludes, &ldquo;<i>On
this principle of inheritance with modification</i>, we can
understand how it is that sections of genera . . . are confined
to the same areas,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who rejects it rejects the <i>vera causa of
ordinary</i> generation,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 352).</p>
<p>We naturally ask, Why call natural selection the &ldquo;main
means of modification,&rdquo; if &ldquo;ordinary
generation&rdquo; is a <i>vera causa</i>?</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the
same time to consider a point equally important for us, namely,
whether the several distinct species of a genus, <i>which on my
theory have all descended from a common ancestor</i>, can have
migrated (undergoing modification during some part of their
migration) from the area inhabited by their progenitor&rdquo; (p.
354).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;on my theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;on our
theory&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With those organic beings which never intercross (if
such exist) <i>the species</i>, <i>on my theory</i>, <i>must have
descended from a succession of improved varieties</i>,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (p. 355).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;on my theory&rdquo; were cut out in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A slow southern migration of a marine fauna will
account, <i>on the theory of modification</i>, for many closely
allied forms,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 372).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the existence of several quite distinct species,
belonging to genera exclusively confined to the southern
hemisphere, is, <i>on my theory of descent with modification</i>,
a far more remarkable case of difficulty&rdquo; (p. 381).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&rdquo; became &ldquo;the&rdquo; in 1866 with the
fourth edition.&nbsp; This was the most categorical claim to the
theory of descent with modification in the &ldquo;Origin of
Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;my&rdquo; here is the only one
that was taken out before 1869.&nbsp; I suppose Mr. Darwin
thought that with the removal of this &ldquo;my&rdquo; he had
ceased to claim the theory of descent with modification.&nbsp;
Nothing, however, could be gained by calling the reader&rsquo;s
attention to what had been done, so nothing was said about
it.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide
range, <i>and allied species</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>on my
theory</i>, <i>are descended from a single source</i>, prevail
throughout the world&rdquo; (p. 385).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;our theory&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to
the mere question of dispersal, but shall consider some other
facts which bear upon the truth of <i>the two theories of
independent creation and of descent with modification</i>&rdquo;
(p. 389).&nbsp; What can be plainer than that the theory which
Mr. Darwin espouses, and has so frequently called
&ldquo;my,&rdquo; is descent with modification?</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as these animals and their spawn are known to be
immediately killed by sea-water, <i>on my view</i>, we can see
that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across
the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic
island.&nbsp; But why, <i>on the theory of creation</i>, they
should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to
explain&rdquo; (p. 393).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; was cut out in 1869.</p>
<p>On the following page we read&mdash;&ldquo;On my view this
question can easily be answered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;On my
view&rdquo; is retained in the latest edition.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet there must be, <i>on my view</i>, some unknown but
highly efficient means for their transportation&rdquo; (p.
397).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; became &ldquo;according to our
view&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of
explanation <i>on the ordinary view of independent creation</i>;
whereas, <i>on the view here maintained</i>, it is obvious that
the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists . . .
from America, and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; and that
such colonists would be liable to modification; the principle of
inheritance still betraying their original birth-place&rdquo; (p.
399).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With respect to the distinct species of the same genus
which, <i>on my theory</i>, must have spread from one parent
source, if we make the same allowances as before,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;on our theory&rdquo;
in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On my theory</i> these several relations throughout
time and space are intelligible; . . . the forms within each
class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary
generation; . . . in both cases the laws of variation have been
the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same
power of natural selection&rdquo; (p. 410).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;according to our
theory&rdquo; in 1869, and natural selection is no longer a
power, but has become a means.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I believe that something more is included</i>, and
that propinquity of descent&mdash;the only known cause of the
similarity of organic beings&mdash;is the bond, hidden as it is
by various degrees of modification, which is partially revealed
to us by our classification&rdquo; (p. 418).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Thus</i>, <i>on the view which I hold</i>, the
natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a
pedigree&rdquo; (p. 422).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the view which I hold&rdquo; was cut out in
1872.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may feel almost sure, <i>on the theory of
descent</i>, that these characters have been inherited from a
common ancestor&rdquo; (p. 426).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On my view of characters being of real importance
for classification only in so far as they reveal descent</i>, we
can clearly understand,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 427).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; became &ldquo;on the view&rdquo; in
1872.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the
number of connecting forms which, <i>on my theory</i>, have been
exterminated and utterly lost&rdquo; (p. 429).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;on my theory&rdquo; were excised in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, we have seen that <i>natural selection</i>
<i>. . . explains</i> that great and universal feature in the
affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in
group under group.&nbsp; <i>We use the element of descent</i> in
classing the individuals of both sexes, &amp;c.; . . . <i>we use
descent</i> in classing acknowledged varieties; . . . and I
believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connection
which naturalists have sought under the term of the natural
system&rdquo; (p. 433).</p>
<p>Lamarck was of much the same opinion, as I showed in
&ldquo;Evolution Old and New.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;An arrangement should be considered
systematic, or arbitrary, when it does not conform to the
genealogical order taken by nature in the development of the
things arranged, and when, by consequence, it is not founded on
well-considered analogies.&nbsp; There is a natural order in
every department of nature; it is the order in which its several
component items have been successively developed.&rdquo; <a
name="citation195a"></a><a href="#footnote195a"
class="citation">[195a]</a>&nbsp; The point, however, which
should more particularly engage our attention is that Mr. Darwin
in the passage last quoted uses &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;
and &ldquo;descent&rdquo; as though they were convertible
terms.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain
this similarity of pattern in members of the same class by
utility or the doctrine of final causes . . .&nbsp; <i>On the
ordinary view of the independent creation of each being</i>, we
can only say that so it is . . . <i>The explanation is manifest
on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight</i>
modifications,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 435).</p>
<p>This now stands&mdash;&ldquo;The explanation is to a large
extent simple, on the theory of the selection of successive,
slight modifications.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not like &ldquo;a large
extent&rdquo; of simplicity; but, waiving this, the point at
issue is not whether the ordinary course of things ensures a
quasi-selection of the types that are best adapted to their
surroundings, with accumulation of modification in various
directions, and hence wide eventual difference between species
descended from common progenitors&mdash;no evolutionist since
1750 has doubted this&mdash;but whether a general principle
underlies the modifications from among which the quasi-selection
is made, or whether they are destitute of such principle and
referable, as far as we are concerned, to chance only.&nbsp;
Waiving this again, we note that the theories of independent
creation and of natural selection are contrasted, as though they
were the only two alternatives; knowing the two alternatives to
be independent creation and descent with modification, we
naturally took natural selection to mean descent with
modification.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the theory of natural selection</i> we can
satisfactorily answer these questions&rdquo; (p. 437).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfactorily&rdquo; now stands &ldquo;to a certain
extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On my view</i> these terms may be used
literally&rdquo; (pp. 438, 439).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; became &ldquo;according to the views
here maintained such language may be,&rdquo; &amp;c., in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe all these facts can be explained as follows,
<i>on the view of descent with modification</i>&rdquo; (p.
443).</p>
<p>This sentence now ends at &ldquo;follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take a genus of birds, <i>descended</i>, <i>on
my theory</i>, <i>from some one parent species</i>, and of which
the several new species <i>have become modified through natural
selection</i> in accordance with their divers habits&rdquo; (p.
446).</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;on my theory&rdquo; were cut out in 1869, and
the passage now stands, &ldquo;Let us take a group of birds,
descended from some ancient form and modified through natural
selection for different habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On my view of descent with modification</i>, the
origin of rudimentary organs is simple&rdquo; (p. 454).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; became &ldquo;<i>on the
view</i>&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the view of descent with modification</i>,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (p. 455).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On this same view of descent with modification</i>
all the great facts of morphology become intelligible&rdquo; (p.
456).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That many and grave objections may be advanced against
<i>the theory of descent with modification through natural
selection</i>, I do not deny&rdquo; (p. 459).</p>
<p>This now stands, &ldquo;That many and serious objections may
be advanced against <i>the theory of descent with modification
through variation and natural selection</i>, I do not
deny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, it must be admitted, cases of special
difficulty <i>on the theory of natural selection</i>&rdquo; (p.
460).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&rdquo; has become &ldquo;opposed to;&rdquo; it is
not easy to see why this alteration was made, unless because
&ldquo;opposed to&rdquo; is longer.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties
encountered <i>on the theory of descent with modification</i> are
grave enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grave&rdquo; has become &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; but
there is no other change (p. 461).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As <i>on the theory of natural selection</i> an
interminable number of intermediate forms must have
existed,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&rdquo; has become &ldquo;according
to&rdquo;&mdash;which is certainly longer, but does not appear to
possess any other advantage over &ldquo;on.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
not easy to understand why Mr. Darwin should have strained at
such a gnat as &ldquo;on,&rdquo; though feeling no discomfort in
such an expression as &ldquo;an interminable number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most forcible of the many objections which
may be urged <i>against my theory</i> . . . For certainly, <i>on
my theory</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 463).</p>
<p>The &ldquo;my&rdquo; in each case became &ldquo;the&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the sum of the several chief objections and
difficulties which may be justly urged <i>against my
theory</i>&rdquo; (p. 465).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My&rdquo; became &ldquo;the&rdquo; in 1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grave as these several difficulties are, <i>in my
judgment</i> they do not overthrow <i>the theory of descent with
modifications</i>&rdquo; (p. 466).</p>
<p>This now stands, &ldquo;Serious as these several objections
are, in my judgment they are by no means sufficient to overthrow
<i>the theory of descent with subsequent modification</i>;&rdquo;
which, again, is longer, and shows at what little, little gnats
Mr. Darwin could strain, but is no material amendment on the
original passage.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The theory of natural selection</i>, even if we
looked no further than this, <i>seems to me to be in itself
probable</i>&rdquo; (p. 469).</p>
<p>This now stands, &ldquo;The theory of natural selection, even
if we look no further than this, <i>seems to be in the highest
degree probable</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not only probable, but
was very sufficiently proved long before Mr. Darwin was born,
only it must be the right natural selection and not Mr. Charles
Darwin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is inexplicable, <i>on the theory of creation</i>,
why a part developed, &amp;c., . . . <i>but</i>, <i>on my
view</i>, this part has undergone,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 474).</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my view&rdquo; became &ldquo;on our view&rdquo; in
1869.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they
offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure <i>on
the theory of the natural selection of successive</i>,
<i>slight</i>, <i>but profitable modifications</i>&rdquo; (p.
474).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>On the view of all the species of the same genus
having descended from a common parent</i>, and having inherited
much in common, we can understand how it is,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p.
474).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we admit that the geological record is imperfect in
an extreme degree, then such facts as the record gives, support
<i>the theory of descent with modification</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo; . . . The extinction of species . . . almost
inevitably follows on <i>the principle of natural
selection</i>&rdquo; (p. 475).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; has got a great deal to answer
for.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can understand, <i>on the theory of descent with
modification</i>, most of the great leading facts in
Distribution&rdquo; (p. 476).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existence of closely allied or representative
species in any two areas, implies, <i>on the theory of descent
with modification</i>, that the same parents formerly inhabited
both areas . . . It must be admitted that these facts receive no
explanation <i>on the theory of creation</i> . . . The fact . . .
is intelligible <i>on the theory of natural selection</i>, with
its contingencies of extinction and divergence of
character&rdquo; (p. 478).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innumerable other such facts at once explain themselves
<i>on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive
modifications</i>&rdquo; (p. 479).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more
weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a
certain number of facts, <i>will certainly reject my
theory</i>&rdquo; (p. 482).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My theory&rdquo; became &ldquo;the theory&rdquo; in
1869.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From this point to the end of the book the claim is so
ubiquitous, either expressly or by implication, that it is
difficult to know what not to quote.&nbsp; I must, however,
content myself with only a few more extracts.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be asked <i>how far I extend the doctrine of the
modification of species</i>&rdquo; (p. 482).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the
belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one
prototype . . . Therefore I should infer from analogy that
probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this
earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which
life was first breathed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From an am&oelig;ba&mdash;Adam, in fact, though not in
name.&nbsp; This last sentence is now completely altered, as well
it might be.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When <i>the views entertained in this volume on the
origin of species</i>, <i>or when analogous views are generally
admitted</i>, we can dimly foresee that there will be a
considerable revolution in natural history&rdquo; (p. 434).</p>
<p>Possibly.&nbsp; This now stands, &ldquo;When the views
advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace, or when
analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted,
we can dimly foresee,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; When the &ldquo;Origin
of Species&rdquo; came out we knew nothing of any analogous
views, and Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s words passed unnoticed.&nbsp; I do
not say that he knew they would, but he certainly ought to have
known.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will
be opened</i>, on the causes and laws of variation, on
correlation of growth, on the effects of use and disuse, on the
direct action of external conditions, and so forth&rdquo; (p.
486).</p>
<p>Buffon and Lamarck had trodden this field to some purpose, but
not a hint to this effect is vouchsafed to us.&nbsp;
Again;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>When I view all beings not as special creations</i>,
<i>but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived
long before</i> the first bed of the Silurian system was
deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled . . . We can so far
take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretell that it will
be the common and widely spread species, belonging to the larger
and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate
new and dominant species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no alteration in this except that
&ldquo;Silurian&rdquo; has become &ldquo;Cambrian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idyllic paragraph with which Mr. Darwin concludes his book
contains no more special claim to the theory of descent <i>en
bloc</i> than many another which I have allowed to pass
unnoticed; it has been, moreover, dealt with in an earlier
chapter (Chapter XII.)</p>
<h2><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Chapter XV<br />
The Excised &ldquo;My&rsquo;s&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> quoted in all ninety-seven
passages, as near as I can make them, in which Mr. Darwin claimed
the theory of descent, either expressly by speaking of &ldquo;my
theory&rdquo; in such connection that the theory of descent ought
to be, and, as the event has shown, was, understood as being
intended, or by implication, as in the opening passages of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; in which he tells us how he had
thought the matter out without acknowledging obligation of any
kind to earlier writers.&nbsp; The original edition of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; contained 490 pp., exclusive of
index; a claim, therefore, more or less explicit, to the theory
of descent was made on the average about once in every five pages
throughout the book from end to end; the claims were most
prominent in the most important parts, that is to say, at the
beginning and end of the work, and this made them more effective
than they are made even by their frequency.&nbsp; A more
ubiquitous claim than this it would be hard to find in the case
of any writer advancing a new theory; it is difficult, therefore,
to understand how Mr. Grant Allen could have allowed himself to
say that Mr. Darwin &ldquo;laid no sort of claim to originality
or proprietorship&rdquo; in the theory of descent with
modification.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I have only found one place where Mr. Darwin
pinned himself down beyond possibility of retreat, however
ignominious, by using the words &ldquo;my theory of descent with
modification.&rdquo; <a name="citation202a"></a><a
href="#footnote202a" class="citation">[202a]</a>&nbsp; He often,
as I have said, speaks of &ldquo;my theory,&rdquo; and then
shortly afterwards of &ldquo;descent with modification,&rdquo;
under such circumstances that no one who had not been brought up
in the school of Mr. Gladstone could doubt that the two
expressions referred to the same thing.&nbsp; He seems to have
felt that he must be a poor wriggler if he could not wriggle out
of this; give him any loophole, however small, and Mr. Darwin
could trust himself to get out through it; but he did not like
saying what left no loophole at all, and &ldquo;my theory of
descent with modification&rdquo; closed all exits so firmly that
it is surprising he should ever have allowed himself to use these
words.&nbsp; As I have said, Mr. Darwin only used this direct
categorical form of claim in one place; and even here, after it
had stood through three editions, two of which had been largely
altered, he could stand it no longer, and altered the
&ldquo;my&rdquo; into &ldquo;the&rdquo; in 1866, with the fourth
edition of the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the only one of the original forty-five my&rsquo;s
that was cut out before the appearance of the fifth edition in
1869, and its excision throws curious light upon the working of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The selection of the most
categorical my out of the whole forty-five, shows that Mr. Darwin
knew all about his my&rsquo;s, and, while seeing reason to remove
this, held that the others might very well stand.&nbsp; He even
left &ldquo;On my <i>view</i> of descent with
modification,&rdquo; <a name="citation203a"></a><a
href="#footnote203a" class="citation">[203a]</a> which, though
more capable of explanation than &ldquo;my theory,&rdquo;
&amp;c., still runs it close; nevertheless the excision of even a
single my that had been allowed to stand through such close
revision as those to which the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo;
had been subjected betrays uneasiness of mind, for it is
impossible that even Mr. Darwin should not have known that though
the my excised in 1866 was the most technically categorical, the
others were in reality just as guilty, though no tower of Siloam
in the shape of excision fell upon them.&nbsp; If, then, Mr.
Darwin was so uncomfortable about this one as to cut it out, it
is probable he was far from comfortable about the others.</p>
<p>This view derives confirmation from the fact that in 1869,
with the fifth edition of the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
there was a stampede of my&rsquo;s throughout the whole work, no
less than thirty out of the original forty-five being changed
into &ldquo;the,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; &ldquo;this,&rdquo; or
some other word, which, though having all the effect of my, still
did not say &ldquo;my&rdquo; outright.&nbsp; These my&rsquo;s
were, if I may say so, sneaked out; nothing was said to explain
their removal to the reader or call attention to it.&nbsp; Why,
it may be asked, having been considered during the revisions of
1861 and 1866, and with only one exception allowed to stand, why
should they be smitten with a homing instinct in such large
numbers with the fifth edition?&nbsp; It cannot be maintained
that Mr. Darwin had had his attention called now for the first
time to the fact that he had used my perhaps a little too freely,
and had better be more sparing of it for the future.&nbsp; The my
excised in 1866 shows that Mr. Darwin had already considered this
question, and saw no reason to remove any but the one that left
him no loophole.&nbsp; Why, then, should that which was
considered and approved in 1859, 1861, and 1866 (not to mention
the second edition of 1859 or 1860) be retreated from with every
appearance of panic in 1869?&nbsp; Mr. Darwin could not well have
cut out more than he did&mdash;not at any rate without saying
something about it, and it would not be easy to know exactly what
say.&nbsp; Of the fourteen my&rsquo;s that were left in 1869,
five more were cut out in 1872, and nine only were allowed
eventually to remain.&nbsp; We naturally ask, Why leave any if
thirty-six ought to be cut out, or why cut out thirty-six if nine
ought to be left&mdash;especially when the claim remains
practically just the same after the excision as before it?</p>
<p>I imagine complaint had early reached Mr. Darwin that the
difference between himself and his predecessors was unsubstantial
and hard to grasp; traces of some such feeling appear even in the
late Sir Charles Lyell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Principles of
Geology,&rdquo; in which he writes that he had reprinted his
abstract of Lamarck&rsquo;s doctrine word for word, &ldquo;in
justice to Lamarck, in order to show how nearly the opinions
taught by him at the beginning of this century resembled those
now in vogue among a large body of naturalists respecting the
infinite variability of species, and the progressive development
in past time of the organic world.&rdquo; <a
name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a"
class="citation">[205a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Charles Lyell could not
have written thus if he had thought that Mr. Darwin had already
done &ldquo;justice to Lamarck,&rdquo; nor is it likely that he
stood alone in thinking as he did.&nbsp; It is probable that more
reached Mr. Darwin than reached the public, and that the
historical sketch prefixed to all editions after the first six
thousand copies had been sold&mdash;meagre and slovenly as it
is&mdash;was due to earlier manifestation on the part of some of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s friends of the feeling that was afterwards
expressed by Sir Charles Lyell in the passage quoted above.&nbsp;
I suppose the removal of the my that was cut out in 1866 to be
due partly to the Gladstonian tendencies of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
mind, which would naturally make that particular my at all times
more or less offensive to him, and partly to the increase of
objection to it that must have ensued on the addition of the
&ldquo;brief but imperfect&rdquo; historical sketch in 1861; it
is doubtless only by an oversight that this particular my was not
cut out in 1861.&nbsp; The stampede of 1869 was probably
occasioned by the appearance in Germany of Professor
Haeckel&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Creation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
published in 1868, and Mr. Darwin no doubt foresaw that it would
be translated into English, as indeed it subsequently was.&nbsp;
In this book some account is given&mdash;very badly, but still
much more fully than by Mr. Darwin&mdash;of Lamarck&rsquo;s work;
and even Erasmus Darwin is mentioned&mdash;inaccurately&mdash;but
still he is mentioned.&nbsp; Professor Haeckel says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although the theory of development had been already
maintained at the beginning of this century by several great
naturalists, especially by Lamarck and Goethe, it only received
complete demonstration and causal foundation nine years ago
through Darwin&rsquo;s work, and it is on this account that it is
now generally (though not altogether rightly) regarded as
exclusively Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory.&rdquo; <a
name="citation206a"></a><a href="#footnote206a"
class="citation">[206a]</a></p>
<p>Later on, after giving nearly a hundred pages to the works of
the early evolutionists&mdash;pages that would certainly disquiet
the sensitive writer who had cut out the &ldquo;my&rdquo; which
disappeared in 1866&mdash;he continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must distinguish clearly (though this is not usually
done) between, firstly, the theory of descent as advanced by
Lamarck, which deals only with the fact of all animals and plants
being descended from a common source, and secondly,
Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, which shows us
<i>why</i> this progressive modification of organic forms took
place&rdquo; (p. 93).</p>
<p>This passage is as inaccurate as most of those by Professor
Haeckel that I have had occasion to examine have proved to
be.&nbsp; Letting alone that Buffon, not Lamarck, is the foremost
name in connection with descent, I have already shown in
&ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo; that Lamarck goes
exhaustively into the how and why of modification.&nbsp; He
alleges the conservation, or preservation, in the ordinary course
of nature, of the most favourable among variations that have been
induced mainly by function; this, I have sufficiently explained,
is natural selection, though the words &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo; are not employed; but it is the true natural
selection which (if so metaphorical an expression is allowed to
pass) actually does take place with the results ascribed to it by
Lamarck, and not the false Charles-Darwinian natural selection
that does not correspond with facts, and cannot result in
specific differences such as we now observe.&nbsp; But, waiving
this, the &ldquo;my&rsquo;s,&rdquo; within which a little rift
had begun to show itself in 1866, might well become as mute in
1869 as they could become without attracting attention, when Mr.
Darwin saw the passages just quoted, and the hundred pages or so
that lie between them.</p>
<p>I suppose Mr. Darwin cut out the five more my&rsquo;s that
disappeared in 1872 because he had not yet fully recovered from
his scare, and allowed nine to remain in order to cover his
retreat, and tacitly say that he had not done anything and knew
nothing whatever about it.&nbsp; Practically, indeed, he had not
retreated, and must have been well aware that he was only
retreating technically; for he must have known that the absence
of acknowledgment to any earlier writers in the body of his work,
and the presence of the many passages in which every word
conveyed the impression that the writer claimed descent with
modification, amounted to a claim as much when the actual word
&ldquo;my&rdquo; had been taken out as while it was allowed to
stand.&nbsp; We took Mr. Darwin at his own estimate because we
could not for a moment suppose that a man of means, position, and
education,&mdash;one, moreover, who was nothing if he was not
unself-seeking&mdash;could play such a trick upon us while
pretending to take us into his confidence; hence the almost
universal belief on the part of the public, of which Professors
Haeckel and Ray Lankester and Mr. Grant Allen alike
complain&mdash;namely, that Mr. Darwin is the originator of the
theory of descent, and that his variations are mainly
functional.&nbsp; Men of science must not be surprised if the
readiness with which we responded to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s appeal to
our confidence is succeeded by a proportionate resentment when
the peculiar shabbiness of his action becomes more generally
understood.&nbsp; For myself, I know not which most to wonder
at&mdash;the meanness of the writer himself, or the greatness of
the service that, in spite of that meanness, he unquestionably
rendered.</p>
<p>If Mr. Darwin had been dealing fairly by us, when he saw that
we had failed to catch the difference between the
Erasmus-Darwinian theory of descent through natural selection
from among variations that are mainly functional, and his own
alternative theory of descent through natural selection from
among variations that are mainly accidental, and, above all, when
he saw we were crediting him with other men&rsquo;s work, he
would have hastened to set us right.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is with
great regret,&rdquo; he might have written, &ldquo;and with no
small surprise, that I find how generally I have been
misunderstood as claiming to be the originator of the theory of
descent with modification; nothing can be further from my
intention; the theory of descent has been familiar to all
biologists from the year 1749, when Buffon advanced it in its
most comprehensive form, to the present day.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Mr.
Darwin had said something to the above effect, no one would have
questioned his good faith, but it is hardly necessary to say that
nothing of the kind is to be found in any one of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s many books or many editions; nor is the reason why
the requisite correction was never made far to seek.&nbsp; For if
Mr. Darwin had said as much as I have put into his mouth above,
he should have said more, and would ere long have been compelled
to have explained to us wherein the difference between himself
and his predecessors precisely lay, and this would not have been
easy.&nbsp; Indeed, if Mr. Darwin had been quite open with us he
would have had to say much as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should point out that, according to the evolutionists
of the last century, improvement in the eye, as in any other
organ, is mainly due to persistent, rational, employment of the
organ in question, in such slightly modified manner as experience
and changed surroundings may suggest.&nbsp; You will have
observed that, according to my system, this goes for very little,
and that the accumulation of fortunate accidents, irrespectively
of the use that may be made of them, is by far the most important
means of modification.&nbsp; Put more briefly still, the
distinction between me and my predecessors lies in this;&mdash;my
predecessors thought they knew the main normal cause or principle
that underlies variation, whereas I think that there is no
general principle underlying it at all, or that even if there is,
we know hardly anything about it.&nbsp; This is my distinctive
feature; there is no deception; I shall not consider the
arguments of my predecessors, nor show in what respect they are
insufficient; in fact, I shall say nothing whatever about
them.&nbsp; Please to understand that I alone am in possession of
the master key that can unlock the bars of the future progress of
evolutionary science; so great an improvement, in fact, is my
discovery that it justifies me in claiming the theory of descent
generally, and I accordingly claim it.&nbsp; If you ask me in
what my discovery consists, I reply in this;&mdash;that the
variations which we are all agreed accumulate are caused&mdash;by
variation. <a name="citation209a"></a><a href="#footnote209a"
class="citation">[209a]</a>&nbsp; I admit that this is not
telling you much about them, but it is as much as I think proper
to say at present; above all things, let me caution you against
thinking that there is any principle of general application
underlying variation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This would have been right.&nbsp; This is what Mr. Darwin
would have had to have said if he had been frank with us; it is
not surprising, therefore, that he should have been less frank
than might have been wished.&nbsp; I have no doubt that many a
time between 1859 and 1882, the year of his death, Mr. Darwin
bitterly regretted his initial error, and would have been only
too thankful to repair it, but he could only put the difference
between himself and the early evolutionists clearly before his
readers at the cost of seeing his own system come tumbling down
like a pack of cards; this was more than he could stand, so he
buried his face, ostrich-like, in the sand.&nbsp; I know no more
pitiable figure in either literature or science.</p>
<p>As I write these lines (July 1886) I see a paragraph in
<i>Nature</i> which I take it is intended to convey the
impression that Mr. Francis Darwin&rsquo;s life and letters of
his father will appear shortly.&nbsp; I can form no idea whether
Mr. F. Darwin&rsquo;s forthcoming work is likely to appear before
this present volume; still less can I conjecture what it may or
may not contain; but I can give the reader a criterion by which
to test the good faith with which it is written.&nbsp; If Mr. F.
Darwin puts the distinctive feature that differentiates Mr. C.
Darwin from his predecessors clearly before his readers, enabling
them to seize and carry it away with them once for all&mdash;if
he shows no desire to shirk this question, but, on the contrary,
faces it and throws light upon it, then we shall know that his
work is sincere, whatever its shortcomings may be in other
respects; and when people are doing their best to help us and
make us understand all that they understand themselves, a great
deal may be forgiven them.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, we find
much talk about the wonderful light which Mr. Charles Darwin
threw on evolution by his theory of natural selection, without
any adequate attempt to make us understand the difference between
the natural selection, say, of Mr. Patrick Matthew, and that of
his more famous successor, then we may know that we are being
trifled with; and that an attempt is being again made to throw
dust in our eyes.</p>

Mr. Grant Allen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Charles Darwin&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is here that Mr. Grant
Allen&rsquo;s book fails.&nbsp; It is impossible to believe it
written in good faith, with no end in view, save to make
something easy which might otherwise be found difficult; on the
contrary, it leaves the impression of having been written with a
desire to hinder us, as far as possible, from understanding
things that Mr. Allen himself understood perfectly well.</p>
<p>After saying that &ldquo;in the public mind Mr. Darwin is
perhaps most commonly regarded as the discoverer and founder of
the evolution hypothesis,&rdquo; he continues that &ldquo;the
grand idea which he did really originate was not the idea of
&lsquo;descent with modification,&rsquo; but the idea of
&lsquo;natural selection,&rsquo;&rdquo; and adds that it was Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;peculiar glory&rdquo; to have shown the
&ldquo;nature of the machinery&rdquo; by which all the variety of
animal and vegetable life might have been produced by slow
modifications in one or more original types.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
theory of evolution,&rdquo; says Mr. Allen, &ldquo;already
existed in a more or less shadowy and undeveloped shape;&rdquo;
it was Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;task in life to raise this
theory from the rank of a mere plausible and happy guess to the
rank of a highly elaborate and almost universally accepted
biological system&rdquo; (pp. 3&ndash;5).</p>
<p>We all admit the value of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work as having
led to the general acceptance of evolution.&nbsp; No one who
remembers average middle-class opinion on this subject before
1860 will deny that it was Mr. Darwin who brought us all round to
descent with modification; but Mr. Allen cannot rightly say that
evolution had only existed before Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s time in
&ldquo;a shadowy, undeveloped state,&rdquo; or as &ldquo;a mere
plausible and happy guess.&rdquo;&nbsp; It existed in the same
form as that in which most people accept it now, and had been
carried to its extreme development, before Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
father had been born.&nbsp; It is idle to talk of Buffon&rsquo;s
work as &ldquo;a mere plausible and happy guess,&rdquo; or to
imply that the first volume of the &ldquo;Philosophie
Zoologique&rdquo; of Lamarck was a less full and sufficient
demonstration of descent with modification than the &ldquo;Origin
of Species&rdquo; is.&nbsp; It has its defects, shortcomings, and
mistakes, but it is an incomparably sounder work than the
&ldquo;Origin of Species;&rdquo; and though it contains the
deplorable omission of any reference to Buffon, Lamarck does not
first grossly misrepresent Buffon, and then tell him to go away,
as Mr. Darwin did to the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; and
to Lamarck.&nbsp; If Mr. Darwin was believed and honoured for
saying much the same as Lamarck had said, it was because Lamarck
had borne the brunt of the laughing.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; was possible because the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo;
had prepared the way for it.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo;
were made possible by Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin, and these two
were made possible by Buffon.&nbsp; Here a somewhat sharper line
can be drawn than is usually found possible when defining the
ground covered by philosophers.&nbsp; No one broke the ground for
Buffon to anything like the extent that he broke it for those who
followed him, and these broke it for one another.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen says (p. 11) that, &ldquo;in Charles Darwin&rsquo;s
own words, Lamarck &lsquo;first did the eminent service of
arousing attention to the probability of all change in the
organic as well as in the inorganic world being the result of
law, and not of miraculous interposition.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin did indeed use these words, but Mr. Allen omits the
pertinent fact that he did not use them till six thousand copies
of his work had been issued, and an impression been made as to
its scope and claims which the event has shown to be not easily
effaced; nor does he say that Mr. Darwin only pays these few
words of tribute in a quasi-preface, which, though prefixed to
his later editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; is
amply neutralised by the spirit which I have shown to be
omnipresent in the body of the work itself.&nbsp; Moreover, Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s statement is inaccurate to an unpardonable extent;
his words would be fairly accurate if applied to Buffon, but they
do not apply to Lamarck.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin continues that Lamarck &ldquo;seems to attribute
all the beautiful adaptations in nature, such as the long neck of
the giraffe for browsing on the branches of trees,&rdquo; to the
effects of habit.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin should not say that Lamarck
&ldquo;seems&rdquo; to do this.&nbsp; It was his business to tell
us what led Lamarck to his conclusions, not what
&ldquo;seemed&rdquo; to do so.&nbsp; Any one who knows the first
volume of the &ldquo;Philosophie Zoologique&rdquo; will be aware
that there is no &ldquo;seems&rdquo; in the matter.&nbsp; Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s words &ldquo;seem&rdquo; to say that it really
could not be worth any practical naturalist&rsquo;s while to
devote attention to Lamarck&rsquo;s argument; the inquiry might
be of interest to antiquaries, but Mr. Darwin had more important
work in hand than following the vagaries of one who had been so
completely exploded as Lamarck had been.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seem&rdquo;
is to men what &ldquo;feel&rdquo; is to women; women who feel,
and men who grease every other sentence with a
&ldquo;seem,&rdquo; are alike to be looked on with distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; continues Mr. Allen, &ldquo;Darwin gave
no sign.&nbsp; A flaccid, cartilaginous, unphilosophic
evolutionism had full possession of the field for the moment, and
claimed, as it were, to be the genuine representative of the
young and vigorous biological creed, while he himself was in
truth the real heir to all the honours of the situation.&nbsp; He
was in possession of the master-key which alone could unlock the
bars that opposed the progress of evolution, and still he
waited.&nbsp; He could afford to wait.&nbsp; He was diligently
collecting, amassing, investigating; eagerly reading every new
systematic work, every book of travels, every scientific journal,
every record of sport, or exploration, or discovery, to extract
from the dead mass of undigested fact whatever item of implicit
value might swell the definite co-ordinated series of notes in
his own commonplace books for the now distinctly contemplated
&lsquo;Origin of Species.&rsquo;&nbsp; His way was to make all
sure behind him, to summon up all his facts in irresistible
array, and never to set out upon a public progress until he was
secure against all possible attacks of the ever-watchful and
alert enemy in the rear,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 73).</p>
<p>It would not be easy to beat this.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
worst enemy could wish him no more damaging eulogist.</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; Mr. Allen says that Mr. Darwin
&ldquo;felt sadly&rdquo; the inaccuracy and want of profound
technical knowledge everywhere displayed by the anonymous
author.&nbsp; Nevertheless, long after, in the &ldquo;Origin of
Species,&rdquo; the great naturalist wrote with generous
appreciation of the &ldquo;Vestiges of
Creation&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In my opinion it has done excellent
service in this country in calling attention to the subject, in
removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the
reception of analogous views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have already referred to the way in which Mr. Darwin treated
the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges,&rdquo; and have stated the
facts at greater length in &ldquo;Evolution Old and New,&rdquo;
but it may be as well to give Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s words in full;
he wrote as follows on the third page of the original edition of
the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of the &lsquo;Vestiges of Creation&rsquo;
would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of
generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some
plant to the mistletoe, and that these had been produced perfect
as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no
explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptation of
organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of
life untouched and unexplained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; did, doubtless,
suppose that &ldquo;<i>some</i> bird&rdquo; had given birth to a
woodpecker, or more strictly, that a couple of birds had done
so&mdash;and this is all that Mr. Darwin has committed himself
to&mdash;but no one better knew that these two birds would,
according to the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges,&rdquo; be just as
much woodpeckers, and just as little woodpeckers, as they would
be with Mr. Darwin himself.&nbsp; Mr. Chambers did not suppose
that a woodpecker became a woodpecker <i>per saltum</i> though
born of some widely different bird, but Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s words
have no application unless they convey this impression.&nbsp; The
reader will note that though the impression is conveyed, Mr.
Darwin avoids conveying it categorically.&nbsp; I suppose this is
what Mr. Allen means by saying that he &ldquo;made all things
sure behind him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Chambers did indeed believe in
occasional sports; so did Mr. Darwin, and we have seen that in
the later editions of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; he
found himself constrained to lay greater stress on these than he
had originally done.&nbsp; Substantially, Mr. Chambers held much
the same opinion as to the suddenness or slowness of modification
as Mr. Darwin did, nor can it be doubted that Mr. Darwin knew
this perfectly well.</p>
<p>What I have said about the woodpecker applies also to the
mistletoe.&nbsp; Besides, it was Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s business not
to presume anything about the matter; his business was to tell us
what the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; had said, or to
refer us to the page of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; on which we
should find this.&nbsp; I suppose he was too busy
&ldquo;collecting, amassing, investigating,&rdquo; &amp;c., to be
at much pains not to misrepresent those who had been in the field
before him.&nbsp; There is no other reference to the
&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo;
than this suave but singularly fraudulent passage.</p>
<p>In his edition of 1860 the author of the
&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; showed that he was nettled, and said it
was to be regretted Mr. Darwin had read the
&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; &ldquo;almost as much amiss as if, like
its declared opponents, he had an interest in misunderstanding
it;&rdquo; and a little lower he adds that Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
book &ldquo;in no essential respect contradicts the
&lsquo;Vestiges,&rsquo;&rdquo; but that, on the contrary,
&ldquo;while adding to its explanations of nature, it expressed
the same general ideas.&rdquo; <a name="citation216a"></a><a
href="#footnote216a" class="citation">[216a]</a>&nbsp; This is
substantially true; neither Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s nor Mr.
Chambers&rsquo;s are good books, but the main object of both is
to substantiate the theory of descent with modification, and, bad
as the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; is, it is ingenuous as compared
with the &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; Subsequently to
Mr. Chambers&rsquo; protest, and not till, as I have said, six
thousand copies of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; had been
issued, the sentence complained of by Mr. Chambers was expunged,
but without a word of retractation, and the passage which Mr.
Allen thinks so generous was inserted into the &ldquo;brief but
imperfect&rdquo; sketch which Mr. Darwin prefixed&mdash;after Mr.
Chambers had been effectually snuffed out&mdash;to all subsequent
editions of his &ldquo;Origin of Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
no excuse for Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s not having said at least this
much about the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; in his first
edition; and on finding that he had misrepresented him in a
passage which he did not venture to retain, he should not have
expunged it quietly, but should have called attention to his
mistake in the body of his book, and given every prominence in
his power to the correction.</p>
<p>Let us now examine Mr. Allen&rsquo;s record in the matter of
natural selection.&nbsp; For years he was one of the foremost
apostles of Neo-Darwinism, and any who said a good word for
Lamarck were told that this was the &ldquo;kind of mystical
nonsense&rdquo; from which Mr. Allen &ldquo;had hoped Mr. Darwin
had for ever saved us.&rdquo; <a name="citation216b"></a><a
href="#footnote216b" class="citation">[216b]</a>&nbsp; Then in
October 1883 came an article in &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; from which it
appeared as though Mr. Allen had abjured Mr. Darwin and all his
works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two conceivable ways,&rdquo; he then
wrote, &ldquo;in which any increment of brain power can ever have
arisen in any individual.&nbsp; The one is the Darwinian way, by
spontaneous variation, that is to say, by variation due to minute
physical circumstances affecting the individual in the
germ.&nbsp; The other is the Spencerian way, by functional
increment, that is to say, by the effect of increased use and
constant exposure to varying circumstances during conscious
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Allen calls this the Spencerian view, and so it is in so
far as that Mr. Spencer has adopted it.&nbsp; Most people will
call it Lamarckian.&nbsp; This, however, is a detail.&nbsp; Mr.
Allen continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture to think that the first way, if we look it
clearly in the face, will be seen to be practically unthinkable;
and that we have no alternative, therefore, but to accept the
second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like our looking a &ldquo;way&rdquo; which is
&ldquo;practically unthinkable&rdquo; &ldquo;clearly in the
face.&rdquo;&nbsp; I particularly like &ldquo;practically
unthinkable.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose we can think it in theory,
but not in practice.&nbsp; I like almost everything Mr. Allen
says or does; it is not necessary to go far in search of his good
things; dredge up any bit of mud from him at random and we are
pretty sure to find an oyster with a pearl in it, if we look it
clearly in the face; I mean, there is sure to be something which
will be at any rate &ldquo;almost&rdquo; practically
unthinkable.&nbsp; But however this may be, when Mr. Allen wrote
his article in &ldquo;Mind&rdquo; two years ago, he was in
substantial agreement with myself about the value of natural
selection as a means of modification&mdash;by natural selection I
mean, of course, the commonly known Charles-Darwinian natural
selection from fortuitous variations; now, however, in 1885, he
is all for this same natural selection again, and in the preface
to his &ldquo;Charles Darwin&rdquo; writes (after a handsome
acknowledgment of &ldquo;Evolution Old and New&rdquo;) that he
&ldquo;differs from&rdquo; me &ldquo;fundamentally in&rdquo; my
&ldquo;estimate of the worth of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s
distinctive discovery of natural selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he certainly does, for on page 81 of the work itself he
speaks of &ldquo;the distinctive notion of natural
selection&rdquo; as having, &ldquo;like all true and fruitful
ideas, more than once flashed,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; I have
explained <i>usque ad nauseam</i>, and will henceforth explain no
longer, that natural selection is no &ldquo;distinctive
notion&rdquo; of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;distinctive notion&rdquo; is natural selection from among
fortuitous variations.</p>
<p>Writing again (p. 89) of Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s essay in the
&ldquo;Leader,&rdquo; <a name="citation218a"></a><a
href="#footnote218a" class="citation">[218a]</a> Mr. Allen
says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It contains, in a very philosophical and abstract form,
the theory of &lsquo;descent with modification&rsquo; without the
distinctive Darwinian adjunct of &lsquo;natural selection&rsquo;
or survival of the fittest.&nbsp; Yet it was just that lever
dexterously applied, and carefully weighted with the whole weight
of his endlessly accumulated inductive instances, that finally
enabled our modern Archimedes to move the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To account for adaptation, for the almost perfect
fitness of every plant and every animal to its position in life,
for the existence (in other words) of definitely correlated parts
and organs, we must call in the aid of survival of the
fittest.&nbsp; Without that potent selective agent, our
conception of the becoming of life is a mere chaos; order and
organisation are utterly inexplicable save by the brilliant
illuminating ray of the Darwinian principle&rdquo; (p. 93).</p>
<p>And yet two years previously this same principle, after having
been thinkable for many years, had become
&ldquo;unthinkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two years previously, writing of the Charles-Darwinian scheme
of evolution, Mr. Allen had implied it as his opinion &ldquo;that
all brains are what they are in virtue of antecedent
function.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The one creed,&rdquo; he
wrote&mdash;referring to Mr Darwin&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;makes the
man depend mainly upon the accidents of molecular physics in a
colliding germ cell and sperm cell; the other makes him depend
mainly on the doings and gains of his ancestors as modified and
altered by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This second creed is pure Erasmus-Darwinism and Lamarck.</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me easy to understand how survival of the
fittest may result in progress <i>starting from such functionally
produced gains</i> (italics mine), but impossible to understand
how it could result in progress, if it had to start in mere
accidental structural increments due to spontaneous variation
alone.&rdquo; <a name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a></p>
<p>Which comes to saying that it is easy to understand the
Lamarckian system of evolution, but not the
Charles-Darwinian.&nbsp; Mr. Allen concluded his article a few
pages later on by saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first hypothesis&rdquo; (Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s)
&ldquo;is one that throws no light upon any of the facts.&nbsp;
The second hypothesis&rdquo; (which is unalloyed Erasmus Darwin
and Lamarck) &ldquo;is one that explains them all with
transparent lucidity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet in his &ldquo;Charles
Darwin&rdquo; Mr. Allen tells us that though Mr. Darwin
&ldquo;did not invent the development theory, he made it
believable and comprehensible&rdquo; (p. 4).</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Charles Darwin&rdquo; Mr. Allen does not tell us
how recently he had, in another place, expressed an opinion about
the value of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;distinctive
contribution&rdquo; to the theory of evolution, so widely
different from the one he is now expressing with characteristic
appearance of ardour.&nbsp; He does not explain how he is able to
execute such rapid changes of front without forfeiting his claim
on our attention; explanations on matters of this sort seem out
of date with modern scientists.&nbsp; I can only suppose that Mr.
Allen regards himself as having taken a brief, as it were, for
the production of a popular work, and feels more bound to
consider the interests of the gentleman who pays him than to say
what he really thinks; for surely Mr. Allen would not have
written as he did in such a distinctly philosophical and
scientific journal as &ldquo;Mind&rdquo; without weighing his
words, and nothing has transpired lately, <i>apropos</i> of
evolution, which will account for his present recantation.&nbsp;
I said in my book &ldquo;Selections,&rdquo; &amp;c., that when
Mr. Allen made stepping-stones of his dead selves, he jumped upon
them to some tune.&nbsp; I was a little scandalised then at the
completeness and suddenness of the movement he executed, and
spoke severely; I have sometimes feared I may have spoken too
severely, but his recent performance goes far to warrant my
remarks.</p>
<p>If, however, there is no dead self about it, and Mr. Allen has
only taken a brief, I confess to being not greatly edified.&nbsp;
I grant that a good case can be made out for an author&rsquo;s
doing as I suppose Mr. Allen to have done; indeed I am not sure
that both science and religion would not gain if every one rode
his neighbour&rsquo;s theory, as at a donkey-race, and the least
plausible were held to win; but surely, as things stand, a writer
by the mere fact of publishing a book professes to be giving a
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> opinion.&nbsp; The analogy of the bar does
not hold, for not only is it perfectly understood that a
barrister does not necessarily state his own opinions, but there
exists a strict though unwritten code to protect the public
against the abuses to which such a system must be liable.&nbsp;
In religion and science no such code exists&mdash;the supposition
being that these two holy callings are above the necessity for
anything of the kind.&nbsp; Science and religion are not as
business is; still, if the public do not wish to be taken in,
they must be at some pains to find out whether they are in the
hands of one who, while pretending to be a judge, is in reality a
paid advocate, with no one&rsquo;s interests at heart except his
client&rsquo;s, or in those of one who, however warmly he may
plead, will say nothing but what springs from mature and genuine
conviction.</p>
<p>The present unsettled and unsatisfactory state of the moral
code in this respect is at the bottom of the supposed antagonism
between religion and science.&nbsp; These two are not, or never
ought to be, antagonistic.&nbsp; They should never want what is
spoken of as reconciliation, for in reality they are one.&nbsp;
Religion is the quintessence of science, and science the raw
material of religion; when people talk about reconciling religion
and science they do not mean what they say; they mean reconciling
the statements made by one set of professional men with those
made by another set whose interests lie in the opposite
direction&mdash;and with no recognised president of the court to
keep them within due bounds this is not always easy.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time it must be steadily remembered that
there are many naturalists at the present day, especially among
those of the lower order of intelligence, who, while accepting
evolutionism in a general way, and therefore always describing
themselves as Darwinians, do not believe, and often cannot even
understand, the distinctive Darwinian addition to the
evolutionary doctrine&mdash;namely, the principle of natural
selection.&nbsp; Such hazy and indistinct thinkers as these are
still really at the prior stage of Lamarckian evolution&rdquo;
(p. 199).</p>
<p>Considering that Mr. Allen was at that stage himself so
recently, he might deal more tenderly with others who still find
&ldquo;the distinctive Darwinian adjunct&rdquo;
&ldquo;unthinkable.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is perhaps, however, because
he remembers his difficulties that Mr. Allen goes on as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable that in the future, while a formal
acceptance of Darwinism becomes general, the special theory of
natural selection will be thoroughly understood and assimilated
only by the more abstract and philosophical minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the kind of people, in fact, who read the <i>Spectator</i>
and are called thoughtful; and in point of fact less than a
twelvemonth after this passage was written, natural selection was
publicly abjured as &ldquo;a theory of the origin of
species&rdquo; by Mr. Romanes himself, with the implied approval
of the <i>Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; continues Mr. Allen, &ldquo;the name of
Darwin will often no doubt be tacked on to what are in reality
the principles of Lamarck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It requires no great power of prophecy to foretell this,
considering that it is done daily by nine out of ten who call
themselves Darwinians.&nbsp; Ask ten people of ordinary
intelligence how Mr. Darwin explains the fact that giraffes have
long necks, and nine of them will answer &ldquo;through
continually stretching them to reach higher and higher
boughs.&rdquo;&nbsp; They do not understand that this is the
Lamarckian view of evolution, not the Darwinian; nor will Mr.
Allen&rsquo;s book greatly help the ordinary reader to catch the
difference between the two theories, in spite of his frequent
reference to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;distinctive
feature,&rdquo; and to his &ldquo;master-key.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
doubt the British public will get to understand all about it some
day, but it can hardly be expected to do so all at once,
considering the way in which Mr. Allen and so many more throw
dust in its eyes, and will doubtless continue to throw it as long
as an honest penny is to be turned by doing so.&nbsp; Mr. Allen,
then, is probably right in saying that &ldquo;the name of Darwin
will no doubt be often tacked on to what are in reality the
principles of Lamarck,&rdquo; nor can it be denied that Mr.
Darwin, by his practice of using &ldquo;the theory of natural
selection&rdquo; as though it were a synonym for &ldquo;the
theory of descent with modification,&rdquo; contributed to this
result.</p>
<p>I do not myself doubt that he intended to do this, but Mr.
Allen would say no less confidently he did not.&nbsp; He writes
of Mr. Darwin as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Darwin&rsquo;s pure and exalted moral nature no
Englishman of the present generation can trust himself to speak
with becoming moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proceeds to trust himself thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His love of truth, his singleness of heart, his
sincerity, his earnestness, his modesty, his candour, his
absolute sinking of self and selfishness&mdash;these, indeed are
all conspicuous to every reader on the very face of every word he
ever printed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This &ldquo;conspicuous sinking of self&rdquo; is of a piece
with the &ldquo;delightful unostentatiousness <i>which every one
must have noticed</i>&rdquo; about which Mr. Allen writes on page
65.&nbsp; Does he mean that Mr. Darwin was &ldquo;ostentatiously
unostentatious,&rdquo; or that he was &ldquo;unostentatiously
ostentatious&rdquo;?&nbsp; I think we may guess from this passage
who it was that in the old days of the <i>Pall Mall Gazelle</i>
called Mr. Darwin &ldquo;a master of a certain happy
simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Allen continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like his works themselves, they must long outlive
him.&nbsp; But his sympathetic kindliness, his ready generosity,
the staunchness of his friendship, the width and depth and
breadth of his affections, the manner in which &lsquo;he bore
with those who blamed him unjustly without blaming them
again&rsquo;&mdash;these things can never be so well known to any
other generation of men as to the three generations that walked
the world with him&rdquo; (pp. 174, 175).</p>
<p>Again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He began early in life to collect and arrange a vast
encyclop&aelig;dia of facts, all finally focussed with supreme
skill upon the great principle he so clearly perceived and so
lucidly expounded.&nbsp; He brought to bear upon the question an
amount of personal observation, of minute experiment, of
world-wide book knowledge, of universal scientific ability, such
as never, perhaps, was lavished by any other man upon any other
department of study.&nbsp; His conspicuous and beautiful love of
truth, his unflinching candour, his transparent fearlessness and
honesty of purpose, his childlike simplicity, his modesty of
demeanour, his charming manner, his affectionate disposition, his
kindliness to friends, his courtesy to opponents, his gentleness
to harsh and often bitter assailants, kindled in the minds of men
of science everywhere throughout the world a contagious
enthusiasm only equalled perhaps among the disciples of Socrates
and the great teachers of the revival of learning.&nbsp; His name
became a rallying-point for the children of light in every
country&rdquo; (pp. 196, 197).</p>
<p>I need not quote more; the sentence goes on to talk about
&ldquo;firmly grounding&rdquo; something which philosophers and
speculators might have taken a century or two more &ldquo;to
establish in embryo;&rdquo; but those who wish to see it must
turn to Mr. Allen&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>If I have formed too severe an estimate of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
work and character&mdash;and this is more than likely&mdash;the
fulsomeness of the adulation lavished on him by his admirers for
many years past must be in some measure my excuse.&nbsp; We grow
tired even of hearing Aristides called just, but what is so
freely said about Mr. Darwin puts us in mind more of what the
people said about Herod&mdash;that he spoke with the voice of a
God, not of a man.&nbsp; So we saw Professor Ray Lankester hail
him not many years ago as the &ldquo;greatest of living
men.&rdquo; <a name="citation224a"></a><a href="#footnote224a"
class="citation">[224a]</a></p>
<p>It is ill for any man&rsquo;s fame that he should be praised
so extravagantly.&nbsp; Nobody ever was as good as Mr. Darwin
looked, and a counterblast to such a hurricane of praise as has
been lately blowing will do no harm to his ultimate reputation,
even though it too blow somewhat fiercely.&nbsp; Art, character,
literature, religion, science (I have named them in alphabetical
order), thrive best in a breezy, bracing air; I heartily hope I
may never be what is commonly called successful in my own
lifetime&mdash;and if I go on as I am doing now, I have a fair
chance of succeeding in not succeeding.</p>

Professor Ray Lankester and Lamarck</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> anxious to give the reader a
sample of the arguments against the theory of natural selection
from among variations that are mainly either directly or
indirectly functional in their inception, or more briefly against
the Erasmus-Darwinian and Lamarckian systems, I can find nothing
more to the point, or more recent, than Professor Ray
Lankester&rsquo;s letter to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> of March
29, 1884, to the latter part of which, however, I need alone call
attention.&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we are introduced to the discredited
speculations of Lamarck, which have found a worthy advocate in
Mr. Butler, as really solid contributions to the discovery of the
<i>ver&aelig; caus&aelig;</i> of variation!&nbsp; A much more
important attempt to do something for Lamarck&rsquo;s hypothesis,
of the transmission to offspring of structural peculiarities
acquired by the parents, was recently made by an able and
experienced naturalist, Professor Semper of Wurzburg.&nbsp; His
book on &lsquo;Animal Life,&rsquo; &amp;c., is published in the
&lsquo;International Scientific Series.&rsquo;&nbsp; Professor
Semper adduces an immense number and variety of cases of
structural change in animals and plants brought about in the
individual by adaptation (during its individual life-history) to
new conditions.&nbsp; Some of these are very marked changes, such
as the loss of its horny coat in the gizzard of a pigeon fed on
meat; <i>but in no single instance could Professor Semper
show</i>&mdash;although it was his object and desire to do so if
possible&mdash;that such change was transmitted from parent to
offspring.&nbsp; Lamarckism looks all very well on paper, but, as
Professor Semper&rsquo;s book shows, when put to the test of
observation and experiment it collapses absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have thought it would have been enough if it had
collapsed without the &ldquo;absolutely,&rdquo; but Professor Ray
Lankester does not like doing things by halves.&nbsp; Few will be
taken in by the foregoing quotation, except those who do not
greatly care whether they are taken in or not; but to save
trouble to readers who may have neither Lamarck nor Professor
Semper at hand, I will put the case as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Professor Semper writes a book to show, we will say, that the
hour-hand of the clock moves gradually forward, in spite of its
appearing stationary.&nbsp; He makes his case sufficiently clear,
and then might have been content to leave it; nevertheless, in
the innocence of his heart, he adds the admission that though he
had often looked at the clock for a long time together, he had
never been able actually to see the hour-hand moving.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; exclaims Professor Ray Lankester on
this, &ldquo;I told you so; the theory collapses absolutely; his
whole object and desire is to show that the hour-hand moves, and
yet when it comes to the point, he is obliged to confess that he
cannot see it do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not worth while to meet
what Professor Ray Lankester has been above quoted as saying
about Lamarckism beyond quoting the following passage from a
review of &ldquo;The Neanderthal Skull on Evolution&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Monthly Journal of Science&rdquo; for June, 1885 (p.
362):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the very next page the author reproduces the
threadbare objection that the &lsquo;supporters of the theory
have never yet succeeded in observing a single instance in all
the millions of years invented (!) in its support of one species
of animal turning into another.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, <i>ex
hypothesi</i>, one species turns into another not rapidly, as in
a transformation scene, but in successive generations, each being
born a shade different from its progenitors.&nbsp; Hence to
observe such a change is excluded by the very terms of the
question.&nbsp; Does Mr. Saville forget Mr. Herbert
Spencer&rsquo;s apologue of the ephemeron which had never
witnessed the change of a child into a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apologue, I may say in passing, is not Mr.
Spencer&rsquo;s; it is by the author of the
&ldquo;Vestiges,&rdquo; and will be found on page 161 of the 1853
edition of that book; but let this pass.&nbsp; How impatient
Professor Ray Lankester is of any attempt to call attention to
the older view of evolution appears perhaps even more plainly in
a review of this same book of Professor Semper&rsquo;s that
appeared in &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; March 3, 1881.&nbsp; The tenor
of the remarks last quoted shows that though what I am about to
quote is now more than five years old, it may be taken as still
giving us the position which Professor Ray Lankester takes on
these matters.&nbsp; He wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;to plainly
and emphatically state&rdquo; (Why so much emphasis?&nbsp; Why
not &ldquo;it should be stated&rdquo;?) &ldquo;that Professor
Semper and a few other writers of similar views&rdquo; <a
name="citation227a"></a><a href="#footnote227a"
class="citation">[227a]</a> (I have sent for the number of
&ldquo;Modern Thought&rdquo; referred to by Professor Ray
Lankester but find no article by Mr. Henslow, and do not,
therefore, know what he had said) &ldquo;are not adding to or
building on Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, but are actually opposing
all that is essential and distinctive in that theory, by the
revival of the exploded notion of &lsquo;directly transforming
agents&rsquo; advocated by Lamarck and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be presumed that these writers know they are not
&ldquo;adding to or building on&rdquo; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory,
and do not wish to build on it, as not thinking it a sound
foundation.&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester says they are
&ldquo;actually opposing,&rdquo; as though there were something
intolerably audacious in this; but it is not easy to see why he
should be more angry with them for &ldquo;actually
opposing&rdquo; Mr. Darwin than they may be with him, if they
think it worth while, for &ldquo;actually defending&rdquo; the
exploded notion of natural selection&mdash;for assuredly the
Charles-Darwinian system is now more exploded than
Lamarck&rsquo;s is.</p>
<p>What Professor Ray Lankester says about Lamarck and
&ldquo;directly transforming agents&rdquo; will mislead those who
take his statement without examination.&nbsp; Lamarck does not
say that modification is effected by means of &ldquo;directly
transforming agents;&rdquo; nothing can be more alien to the
spirit of his teaching.&nbsp; With him the action of the external
conditions of existence (and these are the only transforming
agents intended by Professor Ray Lankester) is not direct, but
indirect.&nbsp; Change in surroundings changes the
organism&rsquo;s outlook, and thus changes its desires; desires
changing, there is corresponding change in the actions performed;
actions changing, a corresponding change is by-and-by induced in
the organs that perform them; this, if long continued, will be
transmitted; becoming augmented by accumulation in many
successive generations, and further modifications perhaps arising
through further changes in surroundings, the change will amount
ultimately to specific and generic difference.&nbsp; Lamarck
knows no drug, nor operation, that will medicine one organism
into another, and expects the results of adaptive effort to be so
gradual as to be only perceptible when accumulated in the course
of many generations.&nbsp; When, therefore, Professor Ray
Lankester speaks of Lamarck as having &ldquo;advocated directly
transforming agents,&rdquo; he either does not know what he is
talking about, or he is trifling with his readers.&nbsp;
Professor Ray Lankester continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not seem to be aware of this, for they make no
attempt to examine Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s accumulated facts and
arguments.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester need not shake
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;accumulated facts and arguments&rdquo;
at us.&nbsp; We have taken more pains to understand them than
Professor Ray Lankester has taken to understand Lamarck, and by
this time know them sufficiently.&nbsp; We thankfully accept by
far the greater number, and rely on them as our sheet-anchors to
save us from drifting on to the quicksands of Neo-Darwinian
natural selection; few of them, indeed, are Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s,
except in so far as he has endorsed them and given them
publicity, but I do not know that this detracts from their
value.&nbsp; We have paid great attention to Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
facts, and if we do not understand all his arguments&mdash;for it
is not always given to mortal man to understand these&mdash;yet
we think we know what he was driving at.&nbsp; We believe we
understand this to the full as well as Mr. Darwin intended us to
do, and perhaps better.&nbsp; Where the arguments tend to show
that all animals and plants are descended from a common source we
find them much the same as Buffon&rsquo;s, or as those of Erasmus
Darwin or Lamarck, and have nothing to say against them; where,
on the other hand, they aim at proving that the main means of
modification has been the fact that if an animal has been
&ldquo;favoured&rdquo; it will be
&ldquo;preserved&rdquo;&mdash;then we think that the
animal&rsquo;s own exertions will, in the long run, have had more
to do with its preservation than any real or fancied
&ldquo;favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester
continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctrine of evolution has become an accepted
truth&rdquo; (Professor Ray Lankester writes as though the making
of truth and falsehood lay in the hollow of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Surely &ldquo;has become accepted&rdquo; should be
enough; Mr. Darwin did not make the doctrine true)
&ldquo;entirely in consequence of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s having
demonstrated the mechanism.&rdquo;&nbsp; (There is no mechanism
in the matter, and if there is, Mr. Darwin did not show it.&nbsp;
He made some words which confused us and prevented us from seeing
that &ldquo;the preservation of favoured races&rdquo; was a cloak
for &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; and that this was all the explanation he
was giving) &ldquo;by which the evolution is possible; it was
almost universally rejected, while such undemonstrable agencies
as those arbitrarily asserted to exist by Professor Semper and
Mr. George Henslow were the only means suggested by its
advocates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the theory of descent with modification, which
received its first sufficiently ample and undisguised exposition
in 1809 with the &ldquo;Philosophie Zoologique&rdquo; of Lamarck,
shared the common fate of all theories that revolutionise opinion
on important matters, and was fiercely opposed by the Huxleys,
Romaneses, Grant Allens, and Ray Lankesters of its time.&nbsp; It
had to face the reaction in favour of the Church which began in
the days of the First Empire, as a natural consequence of the
horrors of the Revolution; it had to face the social influence
and then almost Darwinian reputation of Cuvier, whom Lamarck
could not, or would not, square; it was put forward by one who
was old, poor, and ere long blind.&nbsp; What theory could do
more than just keep itself alive under conditions so
unfavourable?&nbsp; Even under the most favourable conditions
descent with modification would have been a hard plant to rear,
but, as things were, the wonder is that it was not killed
outright at once.&nbsp; We all know how large a share social
influences have in deciding what kind of reception a book or
theory is to meet with; true, these influences are not permanent,
but at first they are almost irresistible; in reality it was not
the theory of descent that was matched against that of fixity,
but Lamarck against Cuvier; who can be surprised that Cuvier for
a time should have had the best of it?</p>
<p>And yet it is pleasant to reflect that his triumph was not, as
triumphs go, long lived.&nbsp; How is Cuvier best known
now?&nbsp; As one who missed a great opportunity; as one who was
great in small things, and stubbornly small in great ones.&nbsp;
Lamarck died in 1831; in 1861 descent with modification was
almost universally accepted by those most competent to form an
opinion.&nbsp; This result was by no means so exclusively due to
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; as is commonly
believed.&nbsp; During the thirty years that followed 1831
Lamarck&rsquo;s opinions made more way than Darwinians are
willing to allow.&nbsp; Granted that in 1861 the theory was
generally accepted under the name of Darwin, not under that of
Lamarck, still it was Lamarck and not Darwin that was being
accepted; it was descent, not descent with modification by means
of natural selection from among fortuitous variations, that we
carried away with us from the &ldquo;Origin of
Species.&rdquo;&nbsp; The thing triumphed whether the name was
lost or not.&nbsp; I need not waste the reader&rsquo;s time by
showing further how little weight he need attach to the fact that
Lamarckism was not immediately received with open arms by an
admiring public.&nbsp; The theory of descent has become accepted
as rapidly, if I am not mistaken, as the Copernican theory, or as
Newton&rsquo;s theory of gravitation.</p>
<p>When Professor Ray Lankester goes on to speak of the
&ldquo;undemonstrable agencies&rdquo; &ldquo;arbitrarily
asserted&rdquo; to exist by Professor Semper, he is again
presuming on the ignorance of his readers.&nbsp; Professor
Semper&rsquo;s agencies are in no way more undemonstrable than
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s are.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin was perfectly cogent as
long as he stuck to Lamarck&rsquo;s demonstration; his arguments
were sound as long as they were Lamarck&rsquo;s, or developments
of, and riders upon, Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck, and
almost incredibly silly when they were his own.&nbsp; Fortunately
the greater part of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; is
devoted to proving the theory of descent with modification, by
arguments against which no exception would have been taken by Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s three great precursors, except in so far as the
variations whose accumulation results in specific difference are
supposed to be fortuitous&mdash;and, to do Mr. Darwin justice,
the fortuitousness, though always within hail, is kept as far as
possible in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s arguments,&rdquo; says Professor Ray
Lankester, &ldquo;rest on the <i>proved</i> existence of minute,
many-sided, irrelative variations <i>not</i> produced by directly
transforming agents.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Darwin throughout the body
of the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; is not supposed to know
what his variations are or are not produced by; if they come,
they come, and if they do not come, they do not come.&nbsp; True,
we have seen that in the last paragraph of the book all this was
changed, and the variations were ascribed to the conditions of
existence, and to use and disuse, but a concluding paragraph
cannot be allowed to override a whole book throughout which the
variations have been kept to hand as accidental.&nbsp; Mr.
Romanes is perfectly correct when he says <a
name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a"
class="citation">[232a]</a> that &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo;
(meaning the Charles-Darwinian natural selection) &ldquo;trusts
to the chapter of accidents in the matter of variation&rdquo;
this is all that Mr. Darwin can tell us; whether they come from
directly transforming agents or no he neither knows nor
says.&nbsp; Those who accept Lamarck will know that the agencies
are not, as a rule, directly transforming, but the followers of
Mr. Darwin cannot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But showing themselves,&rdquo; continues Professor Ray
Lankester, &ldquo;at each new act of reproduction, as part of the
phenomena of heredity such minute &lsquo;sports&rsquo; or
&lsquo;variations&rsquo; are due to constitutional
disturbance&rdquo; (No doubt.&nbsp; The difference, however,
between Mr. Darwin and Lamarck consists in the fact that Lamarck
believes he knows what it is that so disturbs the constitution as
generally to induce variation, whereas Mr. Darwin says he does
not know), &ldquo;and appear not in individuals subjected to new
conditions&rdquo; (What organism can pass through life without
being subjected to more or less new conditions?&nbsp; What life
is ever the exact fac-simile of another?&nbsp; And in a matter of
such extreme delicacy as the adjustment of psychical and physical
relations, who can say how small a disturbance of established
equilibrium may not involve how great a rearrangement?),
&ldquo;but in the offspring of all, though more freely in the
offspring of those subjected to special causes of constitutional
disturbance.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin has further proved that these
slight variations can be transmitted and intensified by selective
breeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin did, indeed, follow Buffon and Lamarck in at once
turning to animals and plants under domestication in order to
bring the plasticity of organic forms more easily home to his
readers, but the fact that variations can be transmitted and
intensified by selective breeding had been so well established
and was so widely known long before Mr. Darwin was born, that he
can no more be said to have proved it than Newton can be said to
have proved the revolution of the earth on its own axis.&nbsp;
Every breeder throughout the world had known it for
centuries.&nbsp; I believe even Virgil knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have,&rdquo; continues Professor Ray Lankester,
&ldquo;in reference to breeding, a remarkably tenacious,
persistent character, as might be expected from their origin in
connection with the reproductive process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The variations do not normally &ldquo;originate in connection
with the reproductive process,&rdquo; though it is during this
process that they receive organic expression.&nbsp; They
originate mainly, so far as anything originates anywhere, in the
life of the parent or parents.&nbsp; Without going so far as to
say that no variation can arise in connection with the
reproductive system&mdash;for, doubtless, striking and successful
sports do occasionally so arise&mdash;it is more probable that
the majority originate earlier.&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester
proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, mutilations and other effects of
directly transforming agents are rarely, if ever,
transmitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Professor Ray Lankester ought to know
the facts better than to say that the effects of mutilation are
rarely, if ever, transmitted.&nbsp; The rule is, that they will
not be transmitted unless they have been followed by disease, but
that where disease has supervened they not uncommonly descend to
offspring. <a name="citation234a"></a><a href="#footnote234a"
class="citation">[234a]</a>&nbsp; I know Brown-S&eacute;quard
considered it to be the morbid state of the nervous system
consequent upon the mutilation that is transmitted, rather than
the immediate effects of the mutilation, but this distinction is
somewhat finely drawn.</p>
<p>When Professor Ray Lankester talks about the &ldquo;other
effects of directly transforming agents&rdquo; being rarely
transmitted, he should first show us the directly transforming
agents.&nbsp; Lamarck, as I have said, knows them not.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is little short of an absurdity,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;for people to come forward at this epoch, when evolution
is at length accepted solely because of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
doctrine, and coolly to propose to replace that doctrine by the
old notion so often tried and rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether this is an absurdity or no, Professor Lankester will
do well to learn to bear it without showing so much warmth, for
it is one that is becoming common.&nbsp; Evolution has been
accepted not &ldquo;because of&rdquo; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
doctrine, but because Mr. Darwin so fogged us about his doctrine
that we did not understand it.&nbsp; We thought we were backing
his bill for descent with modification, whereas we were in
reality backing it for descent with modification by means of
natural selection from among fortuitous variations.&nbsp; This
last really is Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s theory, except in so far as it
is also Mr. A. R. Wallace&rsquo;s; descent, alone, is just as
much and just as little Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s doctrine as it is
Professor Ray Lankester&rsquo;s or mine.&nbsp; I grant it is in
great measure through Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s books that descent has
become so widely accepted; it has become so through his books,
but in spite of, rather than by reason of, his doctrine.&nbsp;
Indeed his doctrine was no doctrine, but only a back-door for
himself to escape by in the event of flood or fire; the flood and
fire have come; it remains to be seen how far the door will work
satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Professor Ray Lankester, again, should not say that
Lamarck&rsquo;s doctrine has been &ldquo;so often tried and
rejected.&rdquo;&nbsp; M. Martins, in his edition of the
&ldquo;Philosophie Zoologique,&rdquo; <a
name="citation235a"></a><a href="#footnote235a"
class="citation">[235a]</a> said truly that Lamarck&rsquo;s
theory had never yet had the honour of being seriously
discussed.&nbsp; It never has&mdash;not at least in connection
with the name of its propounder.&nbsp; To mention Lamarck&rsquo;s
name in the presence of the conventional English society
naturalist has always been like shaking a red rag at a cow; he is
at once infuriated; &ldquo;as if it were possible,&rdquo; to
quote from Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire, whose defence of Lamarck
is one of the best things in his book, <a
name="citation235b"></a><a href="#footnote235b"
class="citation">[235b]</a> &ldquo;that so great labour on the
part of so great a naturalist should have led him to &lsquo;a
fantastic conclusion&rsquo; only&mdash;to &lsquo;a flighty
error,&rsquo; and, as has been often said, though not written, to
&lsquo;one absurdity the more.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such was the language
which Lamarck heard during his protracted old age, saddened alike
by the weight of years and blindness; this was what people did
not hesitate to utter over his grave, yet barely closed, and
what, indeed, they are still saying&mdash;commonly too, without
any knowledge of what Lamarck maintained, but merely repeating at
second hand bad caricatures of his teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will the time come when we may see Lamarck&rsquo;s
theory discussed, and I may as well at once say refuted, in some
important points, with at any rate the respect due to one of the
most illustrious masters of our science?&nbsp; And when will this
theory, the hardihood of which has been greatly exaggerated,
become freed from the interpretations and commentaries by the
false light of which so many naturalists have formed their
opinion concerning it?&nbsp; If its author is to be condemned,
let it, at any rate, not be before he has been heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamarck was the Lazarus of biology.&nbsp; I wish his more
fortunate brethren, instead of intoning the old Church argument
that he has &ldquo;been refuted over and over again,&rdquo; would
refer us to some of the best chapters in the writers who have
refuted him.&nbsp; My own reading has led me to become moderately
well acquainted with the literature of evolution, but I have
never come across a single attempt fairly to grapple with
Lamarck, and it is plain that neither Isidore Geoffroy nor M.
Martins knows of such an attempt any more than I do.&nbsp; When
Professor Ray Lankester puts his finger on Lamarck&rsquo;s weak
places, then, but not till then, may he complain of those who try
to replace Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s doctrine by Lamarck&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Professor Ray Lankester concludes his note thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That such an attempt should be made is an illustration
of a curious weakness of humanity.&nbsp; Not infrequently, after
a long contested cause has triumphed, and all have yielded
allegiance thereto, you will find, when few generations have
passed, that men have clean forgotten what and who it was that
made that cause triumphant, and ignorantly will set up for honour
the name of a traitor or an impostor, or attribute to a great man
as a merit deeds and thoughts which he spent a long life in
opposing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exactly so; that is what one rather feels, but surely
Professor Ray Lankester should say &ldquo;in trying to filch
while pretending to oppose and to amend.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
complaining here that people persistently ascribe Lamarck&rsquo;s
doctrine to Mr. Darwin.&nbsp; Of course they do; but, as I have
already perhaps too abundantly asked, whose fault is this?&nbsp;
If a man knows his own mind, and wants others to understand it,
it is not often that he is misunderstood for any length of
time.&nbsp; If he finds he is being misapprehended in a way he
does not like, he will write another book and make his meaning
plainer.&nbsp; He will go on doing this for as long time as he
thinks necessary.&nbsp; I do not suppose, for example, that
people will say I originated the theory of descent by means of
natural selection from among fortunate accidents, or even that I
was one of its supporters as a means of modification; but if this
impression were to prevail, I cannot think I should have much
difficulty in removing it.&nbsp; At any rate no such
misapprehension could endure for more than twenty years, during
which I continued to address a public who welcomed all I wrote,
unless I myself aided and abetted the mistake.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
wrote many books, but the impression that Darwinism and
evolution, or descent with modification, are identical is still
nearly as prevalent as it was soon after the appearance of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species;&rdquo; the reason of this is, that Mr.
Darwin was at no pains to correct us.&nbsp; Where, in any one of
his many later books, is there a passage which sets the matter in
its true light, and enters a protest against the misconception of
which Professor Ray Lankester complains so bitterly?&nbsp; The
only inference from this is, that Mr. Darwin was not displeased
at our thinking him to be the originator of the theory of descent
with modification, and did not want us to know more about Lamarck
than he could help.&nbsp; If we wanted to know about him, we must
find out what he had said for ourselves, it was no part of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s business to tell us; he had no interest in our
catching the distinctive difference between himself and that
writer; perhaps not; but this approaches closely to wishing us to
misunderstand it.&nbsp; When Mr. Darwin wished us to understand
this or that, no one knew better how to show it to us.</p>
<p>We were aware, on reading the &ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo;
that there was a something about it of which we had not full
hold; nevertheless we gave Mr. Darwin our confidence at once,
partly because he led off by telling us that we must trust him to
a great extent, and explained that the present book was only an
instalment of a larger work which, when it came out, would make
everything perfectly clear; partly, again, because the case for
descent with modification, which was the leading idea throughout
the book, was so obviously strong, but perhaps mainly because
every one said Mr. Darwin was so good, and so much less
self-heeding than other people; besides, he had so
&ldquo;patiently&rdquo; and &ldquo;carefully&rdquo; accumulated
&ldquo;such a vast store of facts&rdquo; as no other naturalist,
living or dead, had ever yet even tried to get together; he was
so kind to us with his, &ldquo;May we not believe?&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;Have we any right to infer that the Creator?&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course we have not,&rdquo; we exclaimed,
almost with tears in our eyes&mdash;&ldquo;not if you ask us in
that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now that we understand what it was that
puzzled us in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work we do not think highly
either of the chief offender, or of the accessories after the
fact, many of whom are trying to brazen the matter out, and on a
smaller scale to follow his example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> evil that men do
lives after them&rdquo; <a name="citation239a"></a><a
href="#footnote239a" class="citation">[239a]</a> is happily not
so true as that the good lives after them, while the ill is
buried with their bones, and to no one does this correction of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s unwonted spleen apply more fully than to Mr.
Darwin.&nbsp; Indeed it was somewhat thus that we treated his
books even while he was alive; the good, descent, remained with
us, while the ill, the deification of luck, was forgotten as soon
as we put down his work.&nbsp; Let me now, therefore, as far as
possible, quit the ungrateful task of dwelling on the defects of
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s work and character, for the more pleasant one
of insisting upon their better side, and of explaining how he
came to be betrayed into publishing the &ldquo;Origin of
Species&rdquo; without reference to the works of his
predecessors.</p>
<p>In the outset I would urge that it is not by any single book
that Mr. Darwin should be judged.&nbsp; I do not believe that any
one of the three principal works on which his reputation is
founded will maintain with the next generation the place it has
acquired with ourselves; nevertheless, if asked to say who was
the man of our own times whose work had produced the most
important, and, on the whole, beneficial effect, I should perhaps
wrongly, but still both instinctively and on reflection, name him
to whom I have, unfortunately, found myself in more bitter
opposition than to any other in the whole course of my
life.&nbsp; I refer, of course, to Mr. Darwin.</p>
<p>His claim upon us lies not so much in what is actually found
within the four corners of any one of his books, as in the fact
of his having written them at all&mdash;in the fact of his having
brought out one after another, with descent always for its
keynote, until the lesson was learned too thoroughly to make it
at all likely that it will be forgotten.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin wanted
to move his generation, and had the penetration to see that this
is not done by saying a thing once for all and leaving it.&nbsp;
It almost seems as though it matters less what a man says than
the number of times he repeats it, in a more or less varied
form.&nbsp; It was here the author of the &ldquo;Vestiges of
Creation&rdquo; made his most serious mistake.&nbsp; He relied on
new editions, and no one pays much attention to new
editions&mdash;the mark a book makes is almost always made by its
first edition.&nbsp; If, instead of bringing out a series of
amended editions during the fifteen years&rsquo; law which Mr.
Darwin gave him, Mr. Chambers had followed up the
&ldquo;Vestiges&rdquo; with new book upon new book, he would have
learned much more, and, by consequence, not have been snuffed out
so easily once for all as he was in 1859 when the &ldquo;Origin
of Species&rdquo; appeared.</p>
<p>The tenacity of purpose which appears to have been one of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s most remarkable characteristics was visible even
in his outward appearance.&nbsp; He always reminded me of
Raffaelle&rsquo;s portrait of Pope Julius the Second, which,
indeed, would almost do for a portrait of Mr. Darwin
himself.&nbsp; I imagine that these two men, widely as the sphere
of their action differed, must have been like each other in more
respects than looks alone.&nbsp; Each, certainly, had a hand of
iron; whether Pope Julius wore a velvet glove or no, I do not
know; I rather think not, for, if I remember rightly, he boxed
Michael Angelo&rsquo;s ears for giving him a saucy answer.&nbsp;
We cannot fancy Mr. Darwin boxing any one&rsquo;s ears; indeed
there can be no doubt he wore a very thick velvet glove, but the
hand underneath it was none the less of iron.&nbsp; It was to his
tenacity of purpose, doubtless, that his success was mainly due;
but for this he must inevitably have fallen before the many
inducements to desist from the pursuit of his main object, which
beset him in the shape of ill health, advancing years, ample
private means, large demands upon his time, and a reputation
already great enough to satisfy the ambition of any ordinary
man.</p>
<p>I do not gather from those who remember Mr. Darwin as a boy,
and as a young man, that he gave early signs of being likely to
achieve greatness; nor, as it seems to me, is there any sign of
unusual intellectual power to be detected in his earliest
book.&nbsp; Opening this &ldquo;almost&rdquo; at random I
read&mdash;&ldquo;Earthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the
prosperity of any country.&nbsp; If, for instance, beneath
England the now inert subterraneous forces should exert those
powers which most assuredly in former geological ages they have
exerted, how completely would the entire condition of the country
be changed!&nbsp; What would become of the lofty houses,
thickly-packed cities, great manufacturies (<i>sic</i>), the
beautiful public and private edifices?&nbsp; If the new period of
disturbance were to commence by some great earthquake in the dead
of night, how terrific would be the carnage!&nbsp; England would
be at once bankrupt; all papers, records, and accounts would from
that moment be lost.&nbsp; Government being unable to collect the
taxes, and failing to maintain its authority, the hand of
violence and rapine would go uncontrolled.&nbsp; In every large
town famine would be proclaimed, pestilence and death following
in its train.&rdquo; <a name="citation240a"></a><a
href="#footnote240a" class="citation">[240a]</a>&nbsp; Great
allowance should be made for a first work, and I admit that much
interesting matter is found in Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s journal; still,
it was hardly to be expected that the writer who at the age of
thirty-three could publish the foregoing passage should twenty
years later achieve the reputation of being the profoundest
philosopher of his time.</p>
<p>I have not sufficient technical knowledge to enable me to
speak certainly, but I question his having been the great
observer and master of experiment which he is generally believed
to have been.&nbsp; His accuracy was, I imagine, generally to be
relied upon as long as accuracy did not come into conflict with
his interests as a leader in the scientific world; when these
were at stake he was not to be trusted for a moment.&nbsp;
Unfortunately they were directly or indirectly at stake more
often than one could wish.&nbsp; His book on the action of worms,
however, was shown by Professor Paley and other writers <a
name="citation242a"></a><a href="#footnote242a"
class="citation">[242a]</a> to contain many serious errors and
omissions, though it involved no personal question; but I imagine
him to have been more or less <i>h&eacute;b&eacute;t&eacute;</i>
when he wrote this book.&nbsp; On the whole I should doubt his
having been a better observer of nature than nine country
gentlemen out of ten who have a taste for natural history.</p>
<p>Presumptuous as I am aware it must appear to say so, I am
unable to see more than average intellectual power even in Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s later books.&nbsp; His great contribution to
science is supposed to have been the theory of natural selection,
but enough has been said to show that this, if understood as he
ought to have meant it to be understood, cannot be rated highly
as an intellectual achievement.&nbsp; His other most important
contribution was his provisional theory of pan-genesis, which is
admitted on all hands to have been a failure.&nbsp; Though,
however, it is not likely that posterity will consider him as a
man of transcendent intellectual power, he must be admitted to
have been richly endowed with a much more valuable quality than
either originality or literary power&mdash;I mean with <i>savoir
faire</i>.&nbsp; The cards he held&mdash;and, on the whole, his
hand was a good one&mdash;he played with judgment; and though not
one of those who would have achieved greatness under any
circumstances, he nevertheless did achieve greatness of no mean
order.&nbsp; Greatness, indeed, of the highest kind&mdash;that of
one who is without fear and without reproach&mdash;will not
ultimately be allowed him, but greatness of a rare kind can only
be denied him by those whose judgment is perverted by temper or
personal ill-will.&nbsp; He found the world believing in fixity
of species, and left it believing&mdash;in spite of his own
doctrine&mdash;in descent with modification.</p>
<p>I have said on an earlier page that Mr. Darwin was heir to a
discredited truth, and left behind him an accredited
fallacy.&nbsp; This is true as regards men of science and
cultured classes who understood his distinctive feature, or
thought they did, and so long as Mr. Darwin lived accepted it
with very rare exceptions; but it is not true as regards the
unreading, unreflecting public, who seized the salient point of
descent with modification only, and troubled themselves little
about the distinctive feature.&nbsp; It would almost seem as if
Mr. Darwin had reversed the usual practice of philosophers and
given his esoteric doctrine to the world, while reserving the
exoteric for his most intimate and faithful adherents.&nbsp;
This, however, is a detail; the main fact is, that Mr. Darwin
brought us all round to evolution.&nbsp; True, it was Mr. Darwin
backed by the <i>Times</i> and the other most influential organs
of science and culture, but it was one of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
great merits to have developed and organised this backing, as
part of the work which he knew was essential if so great a
revolution was to be effected.</p>
<p>This is an exceedingly difficult and delicate thing to
do.&nbsp; If people think they need only write striking and
well-considered books, and that then the <i>Times</i> will
immediately set to work to call attention to them, I should
advise them not to be too hasty in basing action upon this
hypothesis.&nbsp; I should advise them to be even less hasty in
basing it upon the assumption that to secure a powerful literary
backing is a matter within the compass of any one who chooses to
undertake it.&nbsp; No one who has not a strong social position
should ever advance a new theory, unless a life of hard fighting
is part of what he lays himself out for.&nbsp; It was one of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s great merits that he had a strong social position,
and had the good sense to know how to profit by it.&nbsp; The
magnificent feat which he eventually achieved was unhappily
tarnished by much that detracts from the splendour that ought to
have attended it, but a magnificent feat it must remain.</p>
<p>Whose work in this imperfect world is not tarred and tarnished
by something that detracts from its ideal character?&nbsp; It is
enough that a man should be the right man in the right place, and
this Mr. Darwin pre-eminently was.&nbsp; If he had been more like
the ideal character which Mr. Allen endeavours to represent him,
it is not likely that he would have been able to do as much, or
nearly as much, as he actually did; he would have been too wide a
cross with his generation to produce much effect upon it.&nbsp;
Original thought is much more common than is generally
believed.&nbsp; Most people, if they only knew it, could write a
good book or play, paint a good picture, compose a fine oratorio;
but it takes an unusually able person to get the book well
reviewed, persuade a manager to bring the play out, sell the
picture, or compass the performance of the oratorio; indeed, the
more vigorous and original any one of these things may be, the
more difficult will it prove to even bring it before the notice
of the public.&nbsp; The error of most original people is in
being just a trifle too original.&nbsp; It was in his business
qualities&mdash;and these, after all, are the most essential to
success, that Mr. Darwin showed himself so superlative.&nbsp;
These are not only the most essential to success, but it is only
by blaspheming the world in a way which no good citizen of the
world will do, that we can deny them to be the ones which should
most command our admiration.&nbsp; We are in the world; surely so
long as we are in it we should be of it, and not give ourselves
airs as though we were too good for our generation, and would lay
ourselves out to please any other by preference.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin
played for his own generation, and he got in the very amplest
measure the recognition which he endeavoured, as we all do, to
obtain.</p>
<p>His success was, no doubt, in great measure due to the fact
that he knew our little ways, and humoured them; but if he had
not had little ways of his own, he never could have been so much
<i>au fait</i> with ours.&nbsp; He knew, for example, we should
be pleased to hear that he had taken his boots off so as not to
disturb his worms when watching them by night, so he told us of
this, and we were delighted.&nbsp; He knew we should like his
using the word &ldquo;sag,&rdquo; so he used it, <a
name="citation245a"></a><a href="#footnote245a"
class="citation">[245a]</a> and we said it was beautiful.&nbsp;
True, he used it wrongly, for he was writing about tesselated
pavement, and builders assure me that &ldquo;sag&rdquo; is a word
which applies to timber only, but this is not to the point; the
point was, that Mr. Darwin should have used a word that we did
not understand; this showed that he had a vast fund of knowledge
at his command about all sorts of practical details with which he
might have well been unacquainted.&nbsp; We do not deal the same
measure to man and to the lower animals in the matter of
intelligence; the less we understand these last, the less, we
say, not we, but they can understand; whereas the less we can
understand a man, the more intelligent we are apt to think
him.&nbsp; No one should neglect by-play of this description; if
I live to be strong enough to carry it through, I mean to play
&ldquo;cambre,&rdquo; and I shall spell it
&ldquo;camber.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder Mr. Darwin never abused this
word.&nbsp; Laugh at him, however, as we may for having said
&ldquo;sag,&rdquo; if he had not been the kind of man to know the
value of these little hits, neither would he have been the kind
of man to persuade us into first tolerating, and then cordially
accepting, descent with modification.&nbsp; There is a
correlation of mental as well as of physical growth, and we could
not probably have had one set of Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s qualities
without the other.&nbsp; If he had been more faultless, he might
have written better books, but we should have listened
worse.&nbsp; A book&rsquo;s prosperity is like a
jest&rsquo;s&mdash;in the ear of him that hears it.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer would not&mdash;at least one cannot think he
would&mdash;have been able to effect the revolution which will
henceforth doubtless be connected with Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
name.&nbsp; He had been insisting on evolution for some years
before the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; came out, but he might
as well have preached to the winds, for all the visible effect
that had been produced.&nbsp; On the appearance of Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s book the effect was instantaneous; it was like the
change in the condition of a patient when the right medicine has
been hit on after all sorts of things have been tried and
failed.&nbsp; Granted that it was comparatively easy for Mr.
Darwin, as having been born into the household of one of the
prophets of evolution, to arrive at conclusions about the fixity
of species which, if not so born, he might never have reached at
all; this does not make it any easier for him to have got others
to agree with him.&nbsp; Any one, again, may have money left him,
or run up against it, or have it run up against him, as it does
against some people, but it is only a very sensible person who
does not lose it.&nbsp; Moreover, once begin to go behind
achievement and there is an end of everything.&nbsp; Did the
world give much heed to or believe in evolution before Mr.
Darwin&rsquo;s time?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; Did we begin to
attend and be persuaded soon after Mr. Darwin began to
write?&nbsp; Certainly yes.&nbsp; Did we ere long go over <i>en
masse</i>?&nbsp; Assuredly.&nbsp; If, as I said in &ldquo;Life
and Habit,&rdquo; any one asks who taught the world to believe in
evolution, the answer to the end of time must be that it was Mr.
Darwin.&nbsp; And yet the more his work is looked at, the more
marvellous does its success become.&nbsp; It seems as if some
organisms can do anything with anything.&nbsp; Beethoven picked
his teeth with the snuffers, and seems to have picked them
sufficiently to his satisfaction.&nbsp; So Mr. Darwin with one of
the worst styles imaginable did all that the clearest, tersest
writer could have done.&nbsp; Strange, that such a master of
cunning (in the sense of my title) should have been the apostle
of luck, and one so terribly unlucky as Lamarck, of cunning, but
such is the irony of nature.&nbsp; Buffon planted, Erasmus Darwin
and Lamarck watered, but it was Mr. Darwin who said, &ldquo;That
fruit is ripe,&rdquo; and shook it into his lap.</p>
<p>With this Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s best friends ought to be content;
his admirers are not well advised in representing him as endowed
with all sorts of qualities which he was very far from
possessing.&nbsp; Thus it is pretended that he was one of those
men who were ever on the watch for new ideas, ever ready to give
a helping hand to those who were trying to advance our knowledge,
ever willing to own to a mistake and give up even his most
cherished ideas if truth required them at his hands.&nbsp; No
conception can be more wantonly inexact.&nbsp; I grant that if a
writer was sufficiently at once incompetent and obsequious Mr.
Darwin was &ldquo;ever ready,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; So the
Emperors of Austria wash a few poor people&rsquo;s feet on some
one of the festivals of the Church, but it would not be safe to
generalise from this yearly ceremony, and conclude that the
Emperors of Austria are in the habit of washing poor
people&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; I can understand Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s
not having taken any public notice, for example, of &ldquo;Life
and Habit,&rdquo; for though I did not attack him in force in
that book, it was abundantly clear that an attack could not be
long delayed, and a man may be pardoned for not doing anything to
advertise the works of his opponents; but there is no excuse for
his never having referred to Professor Hering&rsquo;s work either
in &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; when Professor Ray Lankester first
called attention to it (July 13, 1876), or in some one of his
subsequent books.&nbsp; If his attitude towards those who worked
in the same field as himself had been the generous one which his
admirers pretend, he would have certainly come forward, not
necessarily as adopting Professor Hering&rsquo;s theory, but
still as helping it to obtain a hearing.</p>
<p>His not having done so is of a piece with his silence about
Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck in the early editions of the
&ldquo;Origin of Species,&rdquo; and with the meagre reference to
them which is alone found in the later ones.&nbsp; It is of a
piece also with the silence which Mr. Darwin invariably
maintained when he saw his position irretrievably damaged, as,
for example, by Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s objection already referred
to, and by the late Professor Fleeming Jenkin in the <i>North
British Review</i> (June 1867).&nbsp; Science, after all, should
form a kingdom which is more or less not of this world.&nbsp; The
ideal scientist should know neither self nor friend nor
foe&mdash;he should be able to hob-nob with those whom he most
vehemently attacks, and to fly at the scientific throat of those
to whom he is personally most attached; he should be neither
grateful for a favourable review nor displeased at a hostile one;
his literary and scientific life should be something as far apart
as possible from his social; it is thus, at least, alone that any
one will be able to keep his eye single for facts, and their
legitimate inferences.&nbsp; We have seen Professor Mivart lately
taken to task by Mr. Romanes for having said <a
name="citation248a"></a><a href="#footnote248a"
class="citation">[248a]</a> that Mr. Darwin was singularly
sensitive to criticism, and made it impossible for Professor
Mivart to continue friendly personal relations with him after he
had ventured to maintain his own opinion.&nbsp; I see no reason
to question Professor Mivart&rsquo;s accuracy, and find what he
has said to agree alike with my own personal experience of Mr.
Darwin, and with all the light that his works throw upon his
character.</p>
<p>The most substantial apology that can be made for his attempt
to claim the theory of descent with modification is to be found
in the practice of Lamarck, Mr. Patrick Matthew, the author of
the &ldquo;Vestiges of Creation,&rdquo; and Mr. Herbert Spencer,
and, again, in the total absence of complaint which this practice
met with.&nbsp; If Lamarck might write the &ldquo;Philosophie
Zoologique&rdquo; without, so far as I remember, one word of
reference to Buffon, and without being complained of, why might
not Mr. Darwin write the &ldquo;Origin of Species&rdquo; without
more than a passing allusion to Lamarck?&nbsp; Mr. Patrick
Matthew, again, though writing what is obviously a
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the evolutionary theories of his
time, makes no mention of Lamarck, Erasmus Darwin, or
Buffon.&nbsp; I have not the original edition of the
&ldquo;Vestiges of Creation&rdquo; before me, but feel sure I am
justified in saying that it claimed to be a more or less
Minerva-like work, that sprang full armed from the brain of Mr.
Chambers himself.&nbsp; This at least is how it was received by
the public; and, however violent the opposition it met with, I
cannot find that its author was blamed for not having made
adequate mention of Lamarck.&nbsp; When Mr. Spencer wrote his
first essay on evolution in the <i>Leader</i> (March 20, 1852) he
did indeed begin his argument, &ldquo;Those who cavalierly reject
the doctrine of Lamarck,&rdquo; &amp;c., so that his essay
purports to be written in support of Lamarck; but when he
republished his article in 1858, the reference to Lamarck was cut
out.</p>
<p>I make no doubt that it was the bad example set him by the
writers named in the preceding paragraph which betrayed Mr.
Darwin into doing as they did, but being more conscientious than
they, he could not bring himself to do it without having
satisfied himself that he had got hold of a more or less
distinctive feature, and this, of course, made matters
worse.&nbsp; The distinctive feature was not due to any deep-laid
plan for pitchforking mind out of the universe, or as part of a
scheme of materialistic philosophy, though it has since been made
to play an important part in the attempt to further this; Mr.
Darwin was perfectly innocent of any intention of getting rid of
mind, and did not, probably, care the toss of sixpence whether
the universe was instinct with mind or no&mdash;what he did care
about was carrying off the palm in the matter of descent with
modification, and the distinctive feature was an adjunct with
which his nervous, sensitive, Gladstonian nature would not allow
him to dispense.</p>
<p>And why, it may be asked, should not the palm be given to Mr.
Darwin if he wanted it, and was at so much pains to get it?&nbsp;
Why, if science is a kingdom not of this world, make so much fuss
about settling who is entitled to what?&nbsp; At best such
questions are of a sorry personal nature, that can have little
bearing upon facts, and it is these that alone should concern
us.&nbsp; The answer is, that if the question is so merely
personal and unimportant, Mr. Darwin may as well yield as Buffon,
Erasmus Darwin, and Lamarck; Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s admirers find no
difficulty in appreciating the importance of a personal element
as far as he is concerned; let them not wonder, then, if others,
while anxious to give him the laurels to which he is entitled,
are somewhat indignant at the attempt to crown him with leaves
that have been filched from the brows of the great dead who went
before him.&nbsp; <i>Palmam qui meruit ferat</i>.&nbsp; The
instinct which tells us that no man in the scientific or literary
world should claim more than his due is an old and, I imagine, a
wholesome one, and if a scientific self-denying ordinance is
demanded, we may reply with justice, <i>Que messieurs les
Charles-Darwinies commencent</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Darwin will have a
crown sufficient for any ordinary brow remaining in the
achievement of having done more than any other writer, living or
dead, to popularise evolution.&nbsp; This much may be
ungrudgingly conceded to him, but more than this those who have
his scientific position most at heart will be well advised if
they cease henceforth to demand.</p>

251</span>Chapter XIX<br />
Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now I bring this book to a
conclusion.&nbsp; So many things requiring attention have
happened since it was begun that I leave it in a very different
shape to the one which it was originally intended to bear.&nbsp;
I have omitted much that I had meant to deal with, and have been
tempted sometimes to introduce matter the connection of which
with my subject is not immediately apparent.&nbsp; Such however,
as the book is, it must now go in the form into which it has
grown almost more in spite of me than from <i>malice prepense</i>
on my part.&nbsp; I was afraid that it might thus set me at
defiance, and in an early chapter expressed a doubt whether I
should find it redound greatly to my advantage with men of
science; in this concluding chapter I may say that doubt has
deepened into something like certainty.&nbsp; I regret this, but
cannot help it.</p>
<p>Among the points with which it was most incumbent upon me to
deal was that of vegetable intelligence.&nbsp; A reader may well
say that unless I give plants much the same sense of pleasure and
pain, memory, power of will, and intelligent perception of the
best way in which to employ their opportunities that I give to
low animals, my argument falls to the ground.&nbsp; If I declare
organic modification to be mainly due to function, and hence in
the closest correlation with mental change, I must give plants,
as well as animals, a mind, and endow them with power to reflect
and reason upon all that most concerns them.&nbsp; Many who will
feel little difficulty about admitting that animal modification
is upon the whole mainly due to the secular cunning of the
animals themselves will yet hesitate before they admit that
plants also can have a reason and cunning of their own.</p>
<p>Unwillingness to concede this is based principally upon the
error concerning intelligence to which I have already
referred&mdash;I mean to our regarding intelligence not so much
as the power of understanding as that of being understood by
ourselves.&nbsp; Once admit that the evidence in favour of a
plant&rsquo;s knowing its own business depends more on the
efficiency with which that business is conducted than either on
our power of understanding how it can be conducted, or on any
signs on the plant&rsquo;s part of a capacity for understanding
things that do not concern it, and there will be no further
difficulty about supposing that in its own sphere a plant is just
as intelligent as an animal, and keeps a sharp look-out upon its
own interests, however indifferent it may seem to be to
ours.&nbsp; So strong has been the set of recent opinion in this
direction that with botanists the foregoing now almost goes
without saying, though few five years ago would have accepted
it.</p>
<p>To no one of the several workers in this field are we more
indebted for the change which has been brought about in this
respect than to my late valued and lamented friend Mr. Alfred
Tylor.&nbsp; Mr. Tylor was not the discoverer of the protoplasmic
continuity that exists in plants, but he was among the very first
to welcome this discovery, and his experiments at Carshalton in
the years 1883 and 1884 demonstrated that, whether there was
protoplasmic continuity in plants or no, they were at any rate
endowed with some measure of reason, forethought, and power of
self-adaptation to varying surroundings.&nbsp; It is not for me
to give the details of these experiments.&nbsp; I had the good
fortune to see them more than once while they were in progress,
and was present when they were made the subject of a paper read
by Mr. Sydney B. J. Skertchly before the Linnean Society, Mr.
Tylor being then too ill to read it himself.&nbsp; The paper has
since been edited by Mr. Skertchly, and published. <a
name="citation253a"></a><a href="#footnote253a"
class="citation">[253a]</a>&nbsp; Anything that should be said
further about it will come best from Mr. Skertchly; it will be
enough here if I give the <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of it
prepared by Mr. Tylor himself.</p>
<p>In this Mr. Tylor said:&mdash;&ldquo;The principles which
underlie this paper are the individuality of plants, the
necessity for some co-ordinating system to enable the parts to
act in concert, and the probability that this also necessitates
the admission that plants have a dim sort of intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is shown that a tree, for example, is something more
than an aggregation of tissues, but is a complex being performing
acts as a whole, and not merely responsive to the direct
influence of light, &amp;c.&nbsp; The tree knows more than its
branches, as the species know more than the individual, the
community than the unit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, inasmuch as my experiments show that many
plants and trees possess the power of adapting themselves to
unfamiliar circumstances, such as, for instance, avoiding
obstacles by bending aside before touching, or by altering the
leaf arrangement, it seems probable that at least as much
voluntary power must be accorded to such plants as to certain
lowly organised animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, a connecting system by means of which combined
movements take place is found in the threads of protoplasm which
unite the various cells, and which I have now shown to exist even
in the wood of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the important facts seems to be the universality
of the upward curvature of the tips of growing branches of trees,
and the power possessed by the tree to straighten its branches
afterwards, so that new growth shall by similar means be able to
obtain the necessary light and air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A house, to use a sanitary analogy, is functionally
useless without it obtains a good supply of light and air.&nbsp;
The architect strives so to produce the house as to attain this
end, and still leave the house comfortable.&nbsp; But the house,
though dependent upon, is not produced by, the light and
air.&nbsp; So a tree is functionally useless, and cannot even
exist without a proper supply of light and air; but, whereas it
has been the custom to ascribe the heliotropic and other motions
to the direct influence of those agents, I would rather suggest
that the movements are to some extent due to the desire of the
plant to acquire its necessaries of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more I have reflected upon Mr. Tylor&rsquo;s Carshalton
experiments, the more convinced I am of their great value.&nbsp;
No one, indeed, ought to have doubted that plants were
intelligent, but we all of us do much that we ought not to do,
and Mr. Tylor supplied a demonstration which may be henceforth
authoritatively appealed to.</p>
<p>I will take the present opportunity of insisting upon a
suggestion which I made in &ldquo;Alps and Sanctuaries&rdquo;
(New edition, pp. 152, 153), with which Mr. Tylor was much
pleased, and which, at his request, I made the subject of a few
words that I ventured to say at the Linnean Society&rsquo;s rooms
after his paper had been read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admitting,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;the common protoplasmic origin of animals and
plants, and setting aside the notion that plants preceded
animals, we are still faced by the problem why protoplasm should
have developed into the organic life of the world, along two main
lines, and only two&mdash;the animal and the vegetable.&nbsp;
Why, if there was an early schism&mdash;and this there clearly
was&mdash;should there not have been many subsequent ones of
equal importance?&nbsp; We see innumerable sub-divisions of
animals and plants, but we see no other such great subdivision of
organic life as that whereby it ranges itself, for the most part
readily, as either animal or vegetable.&nbsp; Why any
subdivision?&mdash;but if any, why not more than two great
classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two main stems of the tree of life ought, one would think,
to have been formed on the same principle as the boughs which
represent genera, and the twigs which stand for species and
varieties.&nbsp; If specific differences arise mainly from
differences of action taken in consequence of differences of
opinion, then, so ultimately do generic; so, therefore, again, do
differences between families; so therefore, by analogy, should
that greatest of differences in virtue of which the world of life
is mainly animal, or vegetable.&nbsp; In this last case as much
as in that of specific difference, we ought to find divergent
form the embodiment and organic expression of divergent
opinion.&nbsp; Form is mind made manifest in flesh through
action: shades of mental difference being expressed in shades of
physical difference, while broad fundamental differences of
opinion are expressed in broad fundamental differences of bodily
shape.</p>
<p>Or to put it thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>If form and habit be regarded as functionally interdependent,
that is to say, if neither form nor habit can vary without
corresponding variation in the other, and if habit and opinion
concerning advantage are also functionally interdependent, it
follows self-evidently that form and opinion concerning advantage
(and hence form and cunning) will be functionally interdependent
also, and that there can be no great modification of the one
without corresponding modification of the other.&nbsp; Let there,
then, be a point in respect of which opinion might be early and
easily divided&mdash;a point in respect of which two courses
involving different lines of action presented equally-balanced
advantages&mdash;and there would be an early subdivision of
primordial life, according as the one view or the other was
taken.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the pros and cons for either course must be
supposed very nearly equal, otherwise the course which presented
the fewest advantages would be attended with the probable gradual
extinction of the organised beings that adopted it, but there
being supposed two possible modes of action very evenly balanced
as regards advantage and disadvantages, then the ultimate
appearance of two corresponding forms of life is a
<i>sequitur</i> from the admission that form varies as function,
and function as opinion concerning advantage.&nbsp; If there are
three, four, five, or six such opinions tenable, we ought to have
three, four, five, or six main subdivisions of life.&nbsp; As
things are, we have two only.&nbsp; Can we, then, see a matter on
which opinion was likely to be easily and early divided into two,
and only two, main divisions&mdash;no third course being
conceivable?&nbsp; If so, this should suggest itself as the
probable source from which the two main forms of organic life
have been derived.</p>
<p>I submit that we can see such a matter in the question whether
it pays better to sit still and make the best of what comes in
one&rsquo;s way, or to go about in search of what one can
find.&nbsp; Of course we, as animals, naturally hold that it is
better to go about in search of what we can find than to sit
still and make the best of what comes; but there is still so much
to be said on the other side, that many classes of animals have
settled down into sessile habits, while a perhaps even larger
number are, like spiders, habitual liers in wait rather than
travellers in search of food.&nbsp; I would ask my reader,
therefore, to see the opinion that it is better to go in search
of prey as formulated, and finding its organic expression, in
animals; and the other&mdash;that it is better to be ever on the
look-out to make the best of what chance brings up to
them&mdash;in plants.&nbsp; Some few intermediate forms still
record to us the long struggle during which the schism was not
yet complete, and the halting between two opinions which it might
be expected that some organisms should exhibit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither class,&rdquo; I said in &ldquo;Alps and
Sanctuaries,&rdquo; &ldquo;has been quite consistent.&nbsp; Who
ever is or can be?&nbsp; Every extreme&mdash;every opinion
carried to its logical end&mdash;will prove to be an
absurdity.&nbsp; Plants throw out roots and boughs and leaves;
this is a kind of locomotion; and, as Dr. Erasmus Darwin long
since pointed out, they do sometimes approach nearly to what may
be called travelling; a man of consistent character will never
look at a bough, a root, or a tendril without regarding it as a
melancholy and unprincipled compromise&rdquo; (New edition, p.
153).</p>
<p>Having called attention to this view, and commended it to the
consideration of my readers, I proceed to another which should
not have been left to be touched upon only in a final chapter,
and which, indeed, seems to require a book to itself&mdash;I
refer to the origin and nature of the feelings, which those who
accept volition as having had a large share in organic
modification must admit to have had a no less large share in the
formation of volition.&nbsp; Volition grows out of ideas, ideas
from feelings.&nbsp; What, then, is feeling, and the subsequent
mental images or ideas?</p>
<p>The image of a stone formed in our minds is no representation
of the object which has given rise to it.&nbsp; Not only, as has
been often remarked, is there no resemblance between the
particular thought and the particular thing, but thoughts and
things generally are too unlike to be compared.&nbsp; An idea of
a stone may be like an idea of another stone, or two stones may
be like one another; but an idea of a stone is not like a stone;
it cannot be thrown at anything, it occupies no room in space,
has no specific gravity, and when we come to know more about
stones, we find our ideas concerning them to be but rude,
epitomised, and highly conventional renderings of the actual
facts, mere hieroglyphics, in fact, or, as it were, counters or
bank-notes, which serve to express and to convey commodities with
which they have no pretence of analogy.</p>
<p>Indeed we daily find that, as the range of our perceptions
becomes enlarged either by invention of new appliances or after
use of old ones, we change our ideas though we have no reason to
think that the thing about which we are thinking has
changed.&nbsp; In the case of a stone, for instance, the rude,
unassisted, uneducated senses see it as above all things
motionless, whereas assisted and trained ideas concerning it
represent motion as its most essential characteristic; but the
stone has not changed.&nbsp; So, again, the uneducated idea
represents it as above all things mindless, and is as little able
to see mind in connection with it as it lately was to see motion;
it will be no greater change of opinion than we have most of us
undergone already if we come presently to see it as no less full
of elementary mind than of elementary motion, but the stone will
not have changed.</p>
<p>The fact that we modify our opinions suggests that our ideas
are formed not so much in involuntary self-adjusting mimetic
correspondence with the objects that we believe to give rise to
them, as by what was in the outset voluntary, conventional
arrangement in whatever way we found convenient, of sensation and
perception-symbols, which had nothing whatever to do with the
objects, and were simply caught hold of as the only things we
could grasp.&nbsp; It would seem as if, in the first instance, we
must have arbitrarily attached some one of the few and vague
sensations which we could alone at first command, to certain
motions of outside things as echoed by our brain, and used them
to think and feel the things with, so as to docket them, and
recognise them with greater force, certainty, and
clearness&mdash;much as we use words to help us to docket and
grasp our feelings and thoughts, or written characters to help us
to docket and grasp our words.</p>
<p>If this view be taken we stand in much the same attitude
towards our feelings as a dog may be supposed to do towards our
own reading and writing.&nbsp; The dog may be supposed to marvel
at the wonderful instinctive faculty by which we can tell the
price of the different railway stocks merely by looking at a
sheet of paper; he supposes this power to be a part of our
nature, to have come of itself by luck and not by cunning, but a
little reflection will show that feeling is not more likely to
have &ldquo;come by nature&rdquo; than reading and writing
are.&nbsp; Feeling is in all probability the result of the same
kind of slow laborious development as that which has attended our
more recent arts and our bodily organs; its development must be
supposed to have followed the same lines as that of our other
arts, and indeed of the body itself, which is the <i>ars
artium</i>&mdash;for growth of mind is throughout coincident with
growth of organic resources, and organic resources grow with
growing mind.</p>
<p>Feeling is the art the possession of which differentiates the
civilised organic world from that of brute inorganic matter, but
still it is an art; it is the outcome of a mind that is common
both to organic and inorganic, and which the organic has alone
cultivated.&nbsp; It is not a part of mind itself; it is no more
this than language and writing are parts of thought.&nbsp; The
organic world can alone feel, just as man can alone speak; but as
speech is only the development of powers the germs of which are
possessed by the lower animals, so feeling is only a sign of the
employment and development of powers the germs of which exist in
inorganic substances.&nbsp; It has all the characteristics of an
art, and though it must probably rank as the oldest of those arts
that are peculiar to the organic world, it is one which is still
in process of development.&nbsp; None of us, indeed, can feel
well on more than a very few subjects, and many can hardly feel
at all.</p>
<p>But, however this may be, our sensations and perceptions of
material phenomena are attendant on the excitation of certain
motions in the anterior parts of the brain.&nbsp; Whenever
certain motions are excited in this substance, certain sensations
and ideas of resistance, extension, &amp;c., are either
concomitant, or ensue within a period too brief for our
cognisance.&nbsp; It is these sensations and ideas that we
directly cognise, and it is to them that we have attached the
idea of the particular kind of matter we happen to be thinking
of.&nbsp; As this idea is not like the thing itself, so neither
is it like the motions in our brain on which it is
attendant.&nbsp; It is no more like these than, say, a stone is
like the individual characters, written or spoken, that form the
word &ldquo;stone,&rdquo; or than these last are, in sound, like
the word &ldquo;stone&rdquo; itself, whereby the idea of a stone
is so immediately and vividly presented to us.&nbsp; True, this
does not involve that our idea shall not resemble the object that
gave rise to it, any more than the fact that a looking-glass
bears no resemblance to the things reflected in it involves that
the reflection shall not resemble the things reflected; the
shifting nature, however, of our ideas and conceptions is enough
to show that they must be symbolical, and conditioned by changes
going on within ourselves as much as by those outside us; and if,
going behind the ideas which suffice for daily use, we extend our
inquiries in the direction of the reality underlying our
conception, we find reason to think that the brain-motions which
attend our conception correspond with exciting motions in the
object that occasions it, and that these, rather than anything
resembling our conception itself, should be regarded as the
reality.</p>
<p>This leads to a third matter, on which I can only touch with
extreme brevity.</p>
<p>Different modes of motion have long been known as the causes
of our different colour perceptions, or at any rate as associated
therewith, and of late years, more especially since the
promulgation of Newlands&rsquo; <a name="citation260a"></a><a
href="#footnote260a" class="citation">[260a]</a> law, it has been
perceived that what we call the kinds or properties of matter are
not less conditioned by motion than colour is.&nbsp; The
substance or essence of unconditioned matter, as apart from the
relations between its various states (which we believe to be its
various conditions of motion) must remain for ever unknown to us,
for it is only the relations between the conditions of the
underlying substance that we cognise at all, and where there are
no conditions, there is nothing for us to seize, compare, and,
hence, cognise; unconditioned matter must, therefore, be as
inconceivable by us as unmattered condition; <a
name="citation261a"></a><a href="#footnote261a"
class="citation">[261a]</a> but though we can know nothing about
matter as apart from its conditions or states, opinion has been
for some time tending towards the belief that what we call the
different states, or kinds, of matter are only our ways of
mentally characterising and docketing our estimates of the
different kinds of motion going on in this otherwise uncognisable
substratum.</p>
<p>Our conception, then, concerning the nature of any matter
depends solely upon its kind and degree of unrest, that is to
say, on the characteristics of the vibrations that are going on
within it.&nbsp; The exterior object vibrating in a certain way
imparts some of its vibrations to our brain&mdash;but if the
state of the thing itself depends upon its vibrations, it must be
considered as to all intents and purposes the vibrations
themselves&mdash;plus, of course, the underlying substance that
is vibrating.&nbsp; If, for example, a pat of butter is a portion
of the unknowable underlying substance in such-and-such a state
of molecular disturbance, and it is only by alteration of the
disturbance that the substance can be altered&mdash;the
disturbance of the substance is practically equivalent to the
substance: a pat of butter is such-and-such a disturbance of the
unknowable underlying substance, and such-and-such a disturbance
of the underlying substance is a pat of butter.&nbsp; In
communicating its vibrations, therefore, to our brain a substance
does actually communicate what is, as far as we are concerned, a
portion of itself.&nbsp; Our perception of a thing and its
attendant feeling are symbols attaching to an introduction within
our brain of a feeble state of the thing itself.&nbsp; Our
recollection of it is occasioned by a feeble continuance of this
feeble state in our brains, becoming less feeble through the
accession of fresh but similar vibrations from without.&nbsp; The
molecular vibrations which make the thing an idea of which is
conveyed to our minds, put within our brain a little feeble
emanation from the thing itself&mdash;if we come within their
reach.&nbsp; This being once put there, will remain as it were
dust, till dusted out, or till it decay, or till it receive
accession of new vibrations.</p>
<p>The vibrations from a pat of butter do, then, actually put
butter into a man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; This is one of the
commonest of expressions, and would hardly be so common if it
were not felt to have some foundation in fact.&nbsp; At first the
man does not know what feeling or complex of feelings to employ
so as to docket the vibrations, any more than he knows what word
to employ so as to docket the feelings, or with what written
characters to docket his word; but he gets over this, and
henceforward the vibrations of the exterior object (that is to
say, the thing) never set up their characteristic disturbances,
or, in other words, never come into his head, without the
associated feeling presenting itself as readily as word and
characters present themselves, on the presence of the
feeling.&nbsp; The more butter a man sees and handles, the more
he gets butter on the brain&mdash;till, though he can never get
anything like enough to be strictly called butter, it only
requires the slightest molecular disturbance with characteristics
like those of butter to bring up a vivid and highly sympathetic
idea of butter in the man&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>If this view is adopted, our memory of a thing is our
retention within the brain of a small leaven of the actual thing
itself, or of what <i>qu&acirc;</i> us is the thing that is
remembered, and the ease with which habitual actions come to be
performed is due to the power of the vibrations having been
increased and modified by continual accession from without till
they modify the molecular disturbances of the nervous system, and
therefore its material substance, which we have already settled
to be only our way of docketing molecular disturbances.&nbsp; The
same vibrations, therefore, form the substance remembered,
introduce an infinitesimal dose of it within the brain, modify
the substance remembering, and, in the course of time, create and
further modify the mechanism of both the sensory and motor
nerves.&nbsp; Thought and thing are one.</p>
<p>I commend these two last speculations to the reader&rsquo;s
charitable consideration, as feeling that I am here travelling
beyond the ground on which I can safely venture; nevertheless, as
it may be some time before I have another opportunity of coming
before the public, I have thought it, on the whole, better not to
omit them, but to give them thus provisionally.&nbsp; I believe
they are both substantially true, but am by no means sure that I
have expressed them either clearly or accurately; I cannot,
however, further delay the issue of my book.</p>
<p>Returning to the point raised in my title, is luck, I would
ask, or cunning, the more fitting matter to be insisted upon in
connection with organic modification?&nbsp; Do animals and plants
grow into conformity with their surroundings because they and
their fathers and mothers take pains, or because their uncles and
aunts go away?&nbsp; For the survival of the fittest is only the
non-survival or going away of the unfittest&mdash;in whose direct
line the race is not continued, and who are therefore only uncles
and aunts of the survivors.&nbsp; I can quite understand its
being a good thing for any race that its uncles and aunts should
go away, but I do not believe the accumulation of lucky accidents
could result in an eye, no matter how many uncles and aunts may
have gone away during how many generations.</p>
<p>I would ask the reader to bear in mind the views concerning
life and death expressed in an early chapter.&nbsp; They seem to
me not, indeed, to take away any very considerable part of the
sting from death; this should not be attempted or desired, for
with the sting of death the sweets of life are inseparably bound
up so that neither can be weakened without damaging the
other.&nbsp; Weaken the fear of death, and the love of life would
be weakened.&nbsp; Strengthen it, and we should cling to life
even more tenaciously than we do.&nbsp; But though death must
always remain as a shock and change of habits from which we must
naturally shrink&mdash;still it is not the utter end of our
being, which, until lately, it must have seemed to those who have
been unable to accept the grosser view of the resurrection with
which we were familiarised in childhood.&nbsp; We too now know
that though worms destroy this body, yet in our flesh shall we so
far see God as to be still in Him and of Him&mdash;biding our
time for a resurrection in a new and more glorious body; and,
moreover, that we shall be to the full as conscious of this as we
are at present of much that concerns us as closely as anything
can concern us.</p>
<p>The thread of life cannot be shorn between successive
generations, except upon grounds which will in equity involve its
being shorn between consecutive seconds, and fractions of
seconds.&nbsp; On the other hand, it cannot be left unshorn
between consecutive seconds without necessitating that it should
be left unshorn also beyond the grave, as well as in successive
generations.&nbsp; Death is as salient a feature in what we call
our life as birth was, but it is no more than this.&nbsp; As a
salient feature, it is a convenient epoch for the drawing of a
defining line, by the help of which we may better grasp the
conception of life, and think it more effectually, but it is a
<i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i> only; it is, as I said in
&ldquo;Life and Habit,&rdquo; <a name="citation264a"></a><a
href="#footnote264a" class="citation">[264a]</a> &ldquo;the most
inexorable of all conventions,&rdquo; but our idea of it has no
correspondence with eternal underlying realities.</p>
<p>Finally, we must have evolution; consent is too spontaneous,
instinctive, and universal among those most able to form an
opinion, to admit of further doubt about this.&nbsp; We must also
have mind and design.&nbsp; The attempt to eliminate intelligence
from among the main agencies of the universe has broken down too
signally to be again ventured upon&mdash;not until the recent
rout has been forgotten.&nbsp; Nevertheless the old,
far-foreseeing <i>Deus ex machin&acirc;</i> design as from a
point outside the universe, which indeed it directs, but of which
it is no part, is negatived by the facts of organism.&nbsp; What,
then, remains, but the view that I have again in this book
endeavoured to uphold&mdash;I mean, the supposition that the mind
or cunning of which we see such abundant evidence all round us,
is, like the kingdom of heaven, within us, and within all things
at all times everywhere?&nbsp; There is design, or cunning, but
it is a cunning not despotically fashioning us from without as a
potter fashions his clay, but inhering democratically within the
body which is its highest outcome, as life inheres within an
animal or plant.</p>
<p>All animals and plants are corporations, or forms of
democracy, and may be studied by the light of these, as
democracies, not infrequently, by that of animals and
plants.&nbsp; The solution of the difficult problem of reflex
action, for example, is thus facilitated, by supposing it to be
departmental in character; that is to say, by supposing it to be
action of which the department that attends to it is alone
cognisant, and which is not referred to the central government so
long as things go normally.&nbsp; As long, therefore, as this is
the case, the central government is unconscious of what is going
on, but its being thus unconscious is no argument that the
department is unconscious also.</p>
<p>I know that contradiction in terms lurks within much that I
have said, but the texture of the world is a warp and woof of
contradiction in terms; of continuity in discontinuity, and
discontinuity in continuity; of unity in diversity, and of
diversity in unity.&nbsp; As in the development of a fugue,
where, when the subject and counter subject have been enounced,
there must henceforth be nothing new, and yet all must be new, so
throughout organic life&mdash;which is as a fugue developed to
great length from a very simple subject&mdash;everything is
linked on to and grows out of that which comes next to it in
order&mdash;errors and omissions excepted.&nbsp; It crosses and
thwarts what comes next to it with difference that involves
resemblance, and resemblance that involves difference, and there
is no juxtaposition of things that differ too widely by omission
of necessary links, or too sudden departure from recognised
methods of procedure.</p>
<p>To conclude; bodily form may be almost regarded as idea and
memory in a solidified state&mdash;as an accumulation of things
each one of them so tenuous as to be practically without material
substance.&nbsp; It is as a million pounds formed by accumulated
millionths of farthings; more compendiously it arises normally
from, and through, action.&nbsp; Action arises normally from, and
through, opinion.&nbsp; Opinion, from, and through,
hypothesis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hypothesis,&rdquo; as the derivation of
the word itself shows, is singularly near akin to
&ldquo;underlying, and only in part knowable, substratum;&rdquo;
and what is this but &ldquo;God&rdquo; translated from the
language of Moses into that of Mr. Herbert Spencer?&nbsp; The
conception of God is like nature&mdash;it returns to us in
another shape, no matter how often we may expel it.&nbsp;
Vulgarised as it has been by Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, and
others who shall be nameless, it has been like every other
<i>corruptio optimi&mdash;pessimum</i>: used as a hieroglyph by
the help of which we may better acknowledge the height and depth
of our own ignorance, and at the same time express our sense that
there is an unseen world with which we in some mysterious way
come into contact, though the writs of our thoughts do not run
within it&mdash;used in this way, the idea and the word have been
found enduringly convenient.&nbsp; The theory that luck is the
main means of organic modification is the most absolute denial of
God which it is possible for the human mind to
conceive&mdash;while the view that God is in all His creatures,
He in them and they in Him, is only expressed in other words by
declaring that the main means of organic modification is, not
luck, but cunning.</p>

on p. 254a of my &ldquo;Selections,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; [Now out

same difficulty that I had felt myself, and saw also how alone it
could be met.&nbsp; He makes the wood-wren say, &ldquo;Something
told him his mother had done it before him, and he was flesh of
her flesh, life of her life, and had inherited her instinct (as
we call hereditary memory, to avoid the trouble of finding out
what it is and how it comes).&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Fraser</i>, June,
1867.&nbsp; Canon Kingsley felt he must insist on the continued
personality of the two generations before he could talk about
inherited memory.&nbsp; On the other hand, though he does indeed
speak of this as almost a synonym for instinct, he seems not to
have realised how right he was, and implies that we should find
some fuller and more satisfactory explanation behind this, only
that we are too lazy to look for it.</p>

&ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; March 5, March 12, and April 9,
1885)&mdash;but I think it little likely that this opinion will
meet general approbation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
