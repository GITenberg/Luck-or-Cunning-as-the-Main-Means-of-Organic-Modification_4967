description: This is Butler's fourth book on his one-sided feud with Darwin wherein
  he again rejects Darwinism in favor of a neo-Lamarckian evolutionary view. While
  Butler was growing increasingly self-righteous and resentful over his belief that
  Darwin was deliberately hiding the truth about evolution, it was to be Butler's
  last book on the subject.
